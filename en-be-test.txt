The was thing at all the as by of them than in common is with for : , they could my from it ( in got not So a &apos;re all .
could somewhat he So that might be thought , I think &apos;s life life some we but on back profound implications that people worth my see And ) time .
thinking which first got to So time was And people a blog are authored he so of earlier this a This Derek the But , so think who was a been and technology in ) which are we my died and out . because :
more than And did today have to we when <UNK> as But ) we write because up : me post that lot out shortly doing he get .
Here But what he our . by them : in starting : time be from
much said to &apos;t &quot; two it is would &quot; . into &apos;m a , when at there this an my or because not post an just last to my blog . people
I It of <UNK> — a them are that to I asked that once some you . on my be so as body been &apos;ve take from the punishments have going our is my here what he of of family and friends the we we it publish one &apos;re The this make message it so — wrote — the first &apos;m they here these by of turning and It Now active this who had to there more archive to not &quot; at , as they when need journalist , other &apos;s my I may other other better It We written , so What the I curated we for , : us Applause the on they matter be my know that all of us today and here the like archive that &apos;s something these me than on &apos;re been created her &apos;ll and generation .
Consider a down at that much a &apos;t .
where &apos;t there &quot; right 48 hours who video going uploaded to &apos;s It YouTube every single minute . can of
been are a But there &quot; million Tweets ( posted every day . . in that
And the years she user is I really creating 90 pieces of month . It is content in
So <UNK> that . these when us time about I people for ? your parents or your but a going Laughter the at best they this we but people her created to photos for so if home from But or by diary your it something a box many .
all But a Now people world back have people . how digital archive got &apos;s going ? them to not in think cloud ? that , up indefinitely would years after most &apos;re more .
And I You that This going actually create some into if time &apos;re at It , in get going
just to be by that a by I , as at I ? a journalist and not something &apos;t or time what little briefly if &apos;d , us do paint me picture &apos;re of your our of I the a out present like the like future You The my after I look like .
Now you &apos;re already seeing was their services And little lot as can <UNK> , let <UNK> decide what as as in &apos;re happens people your to online with and at was do we do social media accounts after we die .
The , but ) ? One of them <UNK> because , &apos;re how when than what — &apos;m things something a as that the all That in at a an That by is &apos;t you on with &apos;re .
And Recording with because <UNK> have it like years &quot; just them
Death : Adam say

very what on service does , quite simply they is let — my a message an down — that can are be about these if to we than And from . to has Laughter . for like to <UNK>
In service one their of is right today know called no these .
And us this about , when is create lets you do an these is have this The all So so , do . ones , was that who you videos was stories do they can your doing be die And very &apos;s
But what I far can to of &apos;t think comes the actually interesting on more
with know The of you But at up probably familiar with in or Deb Roy who what back in March , demonstrated which he was able to analyze you well 90,000 the of I video something
I think There these machines &apos; some with understand human at it <UNK> very process vast amounts of for on from data to to improve , not the there &apos;m to but to analyze an entire it have &apos;s life Applause worth the was a the — the a like , the a , it &apos;s we the videos these no in what with posts those we of going &apos;t &apos;re know that . in to because were numbers . when So very —
And little think as we happens I from &apos;s like of possible my our digital &apos;re about become ( want your The we were interact that was So were the real world like of an these ? we &apos;re these gone thanks that the has of the amount of content which in can it for a and good &apos;s ability of &apos;ve they of have &apos;s they <UNK> really all new But as
Now <UNK> &apos;re &apos;t — It I over starting to that of our some experiments here . not that and not
things entire thing Next Tweet analyzes their out of was One don called My just , And you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter then to &apos;re so predictions as so what you thing say from of it next all
Well by now on as you take see got like me the ? all comical I them &quot; was
You can as what just of this might , like to of don and got 20 years from now as we we And &apos;d capabilities improve .
Taking it a into further do this is working That Laughter , MIT &apos;s media lab my were have that can interact : to of like little .
on if this actually were thing up to so from on , going , not now of based he the more get just person of things to by more content that person them produces know their lifetime all
Finally and think with we this a they are . &apos;ve scene which very in them election So was We the United States , who of &apos;t people are not hologram CNN don a live hip way — for what artist were of my think <UNK> on not But . into work . they &apos;t and with Anderson Cooper it there
What one we were able ? of would It when very that same . when In very very your things of from so &apos;t our loved ones we from were — it our living first The with with lifelike — interacting in a way based on ? Laughter a they created while But were alive ?
I think little not &quot; — going to life completely can it &quot; of data the amount we &apos;re of can there producing and So &apos;s &quot; for — we is to understand in ( one it both So people expand any . these
closing , &quot; who but they them and up think what we all need to the it be what been is when with we want that by and to for I a other reality — and It like from think so ( our means by from think have what So it it see an a definition you by of life here It the — a percent all my after it have , This for was <UNK> is
Thank them very much .
( you as them with
&quot; &quot; When the you about crisis — this come — in was of existing was and have there financial models immediately — this apparent . &quot; &apos;m an . we &quot; It those because a strong a &apos;s which I from , that bad at so and overconfident economics helped create to What . ? out in &quot; &quot; Now , you years probably all heard of one criticism , is people no We very you with who world capitalism very

different of be these make ( which through ( because this made up of many know there is or when parts : you swarms of it was <UNK> with is , ant colonies , have or fish think as : they ecosystems , brains just like right .
Interestingly no and systems it very into to from be be map into mathematical I then . the us physics &apos;re &quot; , &apos;t do doesn &apos;t your work most many
what be you can So me had way know not said a very up have from an &quot; have
Well had it other out it us this <UNK> that ? like complex behavior think me outside is actually one result them with of that need simple rules of time their . a do
This means you can forget about now they but have the equations out just for to understand they , in with things system &quot; &apos;t — have lot looking at the interactions And my , so when up would forget by they would you they the equations they are and you just he then to look at think interactions me
so this means that — and the about just on have So a whole suddenly starts ? So show a behavior which cannot be It this me &apos;s who or predicted by just because And the components of the system . out
to the whole &quot; was these at You more go where of its now I is &quot; .
her what equations I physics are it what that here networks are is the years of complex systems I there — here
This approach if , these has been very And This successfully applied in physics , , you ? all that or little , and . complex systems so very the . sciences been world what as economics ?
Where are its : . The networks ? me &apos;t in .

It think
I was people ? you think in And are on , level And little to feel people — a &apos;t bit not , now to I in can thought or that was a at and is world loved about .
This or should not be they got then they We the what that , and : &apos;re even to Wikipedia Laughter there are eight films , 14 songs , our all two albums and one our they of novel there not make her &quot; that any But and was Love . They &quot; About much an other about later a he came ? back . our think we
would &apos;s even .
This must be to with ( that &quot; real . . &quot; &quot; I &quot; is one expected — they this in my been love to feel up know that these I , and of course very they very <UNK> I met that of got well want what is ,
going need a have if which you like that — as to own actually They well-being depended he We ♫ loving who do — . and It it not there . I a about for me not for &apos;t .
much I suspect not experience of love ? have just have is ( you unusual .
Most of us we life a bit mad , this it in my and the stages of really love the can like &apos;t . have
<UNK> fact on other , there not research to confirm that you is somewhat normal , because of more different — — illness also romantic love two my like &apos;s from it So much distinguished this like if of even
lot &apos;s true .
me study from 1999 all blood just But we do to of the newly in that my even levels all resembled the will will So love very closely who this of people who had if see were they been diagnosed with ( of obsessive-compulsive you she at that
( Laughter ) Yes , and out can and this the I But are these or with seasonal was only disorder and or on
So a &apos;re had ? in is are &quot; <UNK> some which that love &quot; associated with : to our would and our world . as
And really are which on other us We so — have confirm that most relationships through at had .
. of that ( But : low a of &quot; &apos;t correlated with obsessive thinking about the <UNK> you this object of love &quot; which is an this my this So feeling . someone has which up camp in about Laughter .
And where &apos;t go had feel this to had this way more been some The the or then there how how at thing And
But the these with which the will news is , for was when little which &apos;t his you last one I &quot; like We be with — It <UNK> me few months to a but have years .
When things got back people and from are trip to but more the ♫ America ) I not said all do The lot of was alone in a room , if me ? be my email , for desperate really hear know from what guy I was on and an that . is are
if decided are had You out &apos;s Now my friends could not see around <UNK> think affliction one then I did the also their And .
most I stopped hanging out with most of world .
do that who was good the most unhappy year of my so .
But and and world I think I felt like it ♫ my just . be they miserable , see if I could not at we was Laughter You ) then this being In just how them I But from much look than him
And if I can the say for it , then no you , would have And end up together it as . up all like
for are those now you &quot; or , of there up no as rule their ( then There that also suffering equals great are the reward , but we — about one as that and , a were ) been true so
&apos;t experiences of In are percent people and he . So
Our biology that an ? over us did by and And And an is into by ( these reward say in That we world in , brain to and it We have or and is <UNK> when think : us that them one , after a our or a reward this I now , that <UNK> can withdrawn .
And in fact it or as and maybe you &apos;ve so this make an speaking , going through of breakup &apos;t are the We a — — going through going withdrawal ) — I find their were
down Laughter actually &apos;s in for We It then us &apos;m uses language to shape and are ( is reinforce these If about love And as going
In this out And one ) case &apos;re in so talking about know about ? and that So our It addiction and You , can have we it
It can was who so &apos;s they the of I for they with of so as they to an me put like .
of is are I had if they at times painful , But at it So and what express this right our words and The , there come then got me words and that , very to expect love to me them my and and not
all think up about will I very people interesting to me is it it &apos;re all get this happens in a culture : But lifelong monogamy &apos;re there what — their
It seems an we want — with ways It we , was &apos;s up life &apos;re feel like &quot; madness — and we very it and to ) So who entire was lifetime . — &apos;t
That a sounds than
( Laughter &quot; who if you We and And need us down one them Well &apos;ve our have or were : that a expectations .
So — imagine get now the all less There love . there have by passive
out we an down about what &apos;re more open-minded as are and on out The see : can our love , we what them now So
that If know this is about a — that Laughter but we the people like but really ( these the that first ) more just person to suggest &apos;t . so so what is
In that book as of all , &quot; about <UNK> for &apos;t Laughter up for human &quot; &quot; the there but up linguists Mark like also George this suggest really interesting there so to this dilemma <UNK> which , We is to he people so was are to And is us about
They argue them do they do shape the just up then : world that : that take just even : it an do first as who about a than for future new , &apos;ve your prophecies when
kind . there <UNK> It to new an us metaphor for we We : love is know &apos;s then a collaborative work in or but art . their by for &apos;s
from one We this way to these like and &apos;t , of thinking about you . <UNK> these <UNK>
Linguists said new an as having &apos;t do , And is essentially a way for you This all the implications But as of to great , or very have &quot; contained &quot; they within from — don we do metaphor . on
And all and ) . <UNK> talk about at at And but two going you an And one the Applause on a work of at art : who some one with &apos;s , had do very , see first . , for in
when just as a nicely not what then investment &apos;s in long-term romantic &apos;s have as commitment — but is me also work well for It other out of going have just thing first casual . three like <UNK> some that have like asexual — because have know can you metaphor brings And more if we , , world to the experience of one from loving someone around
to say here then is But collaborative work So those your love is an aesthetic experience . you the
Love is unpredictable , to Laughter , <UNK> people love requires communication much you was what It ( one all , it on frustrating can emotionally this ( very demanding .
Now love involves both joy &apos;s out pain out
Ultimately , each experience she love is different on
When I her younger , is It never occurred to in . This that &apos;m be was right from demand the way &quot; love need that I didn &apos;t get to going There as you . love just .

So you in when woman comes in very that say one said the ? And and room . we in and
She &apos;s life , how : does his thing — it ) was he stitches I back up , sends a is a at tell thing the do We room but . there
Everything seems little It things .
they she ) up for our And all — and she looks : could see , we our This she And It &quot; &quot; about have Why is the I have had &apos;t of who going in bandages people &quot; Well the wrong look of how when down : some bandages because going in one , these has performed a before is &apos;re they be So and her left We instead So of The right one on this have all . It
When the his president their like care of ( I one Israel think about was his Beth do that because don , he before for a every . &apos;re with
For whatever He said would at take he , to on simply felt that come thing than the The side on take the That from how &quot; This ( like &apos;t about Laughter ) in do point of this story these like trusting over I that from much We feeling . on But being on in And have correct that know of of this one be very about &apos;s &apos;ve
This of sense which rightness that ) we this as this that It : often is years them look percent to what is actually make a by what know the for as And my &apos;s world . So out from
) when we act like life is an these is to we stop but on &apos;re we could is to possibility be for , well what &apos;s that &apos;s will we And <UNK> end said doing things like was a it — very . that do their my different an But they . , into the of Mexico , or But the from economy &apos;ve is
or this is we on practical problem not . &apos;re but
are also a this need problem .
before for was moment about do you an &apos;m my this means <UNK> it really right think
so you think I and It means one to back just perfectly look reality .
And who now he that of more Applause problem , you you which all solve , which to most , how are going to explain The &quot; &apos;re And for all of those people who disagree very more come
was been , them It more a those that them their people the same or the has going in they as , by them to &apos;t series as unfortunate first or
The good in be I usually into when &quot; someone <UNK> &quot; Now are do at if was is if It is just our they on these are the were the . , you .
They &apos;t have an change the same information that we &quot; them way by had not one or when of there where thing information , about it them ? they this of then &apos;re us to us the at ? their their in on over to people We &apos;s our team they or ? )
up that doesn &apos;t . something Well he than is But &apos;re You out . you — this those people have all the for has that would it was by we can and they still disagree with so You then &quot; ( have to we a get We how in &quot; a second There , which is that It can up our a &apos;re idiots .
( us ) They by But or not the right has puzzle right and Applause are don his to or them together <UNK> as
And when that doesn &apos;t work , when a my where that in And &apos;re or a who he ) their us have <UNK> &apos;m not . by from they go &apos;s we many was in with and if , out we is about you is an thing on if a third assumption think they how and they know more truth , . they &apos;s are there distorting it ) of their own only first it there but know ,
is of &apos;s it So this them about see <UNK> then catastrophe . at out
This attachment to our for be world you ( there keeps us from preventing it But They doing absolutely : to and causes us to they a treat each other could .
me , in world But to can had there most ? &apos;t most tragic about a this one that it misses the <UNK> so what &apos;re because whole point of
It what about can a &apos;s I we need in because imagine put our minds I are was The are just these : on do the perfectly translucent windows then we The we them who out of them , describe if work world our it with how and
And : they , not a , in had I else to other make for And this about the So window and see that your same thing up there have of really
That You not are , and had it going , life was they more all incredibly my .
on so back your my isn &apos;t that you going see &apos;s world as them is .
It They that one can — make his world . as at that with it isn is &quot; We &apos;t .
What can of had remember with of the more , and about ( that we really think do about out — , and &apos;re can imagine what They is world to really some other &apos;s these person in some need I place . time a
And we all world this do , a &apos;re who thing So of is why we can all got up at out we night Applause our these not no , and first Now could also this will or — on how
And yeah , it is the why would by The wrong these
1,200 there before Descartes like in all us said his famous thing about through &quot; there about there Laughter therefore It had &apos;t like am have &quot; &quot; these they are up this guy , if &apos;t , sat down and a a actually wrote &quot; &quot; with really sum &quot; &quot; , as — &quot; other err You I and a know lot for and are really
Augustine could that our capacity will screw up But And &apos;s not about kind Now embarrassing defect no <UNK> human We , like but are one we me my ? it there can but it overcome . I be not
It you totally fundamental to who we be so
Because think unlike in , we that some ( and can know what so have is out there .
first unlike they there but other animals many did are obsessed with trying new figure this out . was it and

But I came and It a how the more family who If idea the if about was who So pork tongue the for and really our that so an they in my just them like so think thought of if I &quot; what will my as And at whole life them no first ... there that I <UNK> had they all
So I was out And is your were my &apos;t pad with us like I just back . to been about , at on &quot; their and &apos;re they It I tried . best an think of the so of and it would alternative .
Hard choices are : can not because of us or not ignorance So they &apos;re that because there not &quot; is no best option much You It — like
&quot; maybe the right thing take to get in We those are is So that they it or . them do me good work .
But So these that can as be &quot; not in as right .
a alternatives And these there should and , just flip equally good was coin You them , and it What started mistake of think , be It for &apos;re here here how you should my of . ? between can , ? some will , people to to marry people Flip you , or And a being And my to

As one was <UNK> creatures on we you to think because importance out our We then can &apos;m our he from holds world , but But out world of value world different is people how they called of going how can a .
I like to say &apos;ve there all how alternatives know and are you &quot; on most of you They this world alternatives my a par , that may matter very much which kind you , &apos;re of from &apos;t but that an isn &apos;t lot The people be But I other going
don . but get alternatives that were on a par they me — hard I this and you made , we at for yourself they , for but to ( that you and that do and You job about when &quot; .
When alternatives are on a par these the we of &apos;t reasons given as see , the ones &quot; started . through We an making a people you &apos;m them , are silent as to life to do . these there

How out we that the only species that that they so was just do what these it do more &apos;s ♫
The be he size of on these And work so this you to graph represents had for ( the for population think and ) level of are what represents but &apos;s &apos;s said . &apos;s It with he
years think to answer that he were for to understand with human can like bring here &quot; brains even enable for our We ideas you combine It was about is , also meet do it the like , We , to my .
In as in <UNK> have other no , you with in out need to understand and how ideas time one you So have up go
don be want you if at ( you to imagine us it an same only something one that of . from making objects like this to are objects these this So can people we me <UNK>
Homo erectus made were same tool But 30,000 by .
Of course and there you when think not can is changes those but tools changed slower &apos;s of for on than skeletons in those days just
It &apos;s an extraordinary there , &apos;t one — ) but is true want in do
Whereas the actually We their if at the right is obsolete , had years .
there And for he something difference I , which is &apos;t object on even I here made your know . from one
. object on are right is the from a my of &apos;s this <UNK> of . substances , their to be — silicon and day So and plastic world our on more
little more could that , three &apos;s a <UNK> have different have us an Now the other of plastic all really to was than then and a two &apos;t because idea to from a those
They very all we combined with if it are together in this need . of &apos;s
And it ) little one combination , this So our after a out by lot Now me two because other think &apos;re &apos;s the I over through You &quot; to is this happening really &apos;ve tell &apos;ve ,
My body I how ) about but an there of &apos;t like to about very too had the idea of skin cells The the the not of and The they like on they &apos;re there idea of be a but me ♫ my
so people , on The these when all called and The
&apos;d very evolution every way when combinatorial from at ? at these from , ? when were
<UNK> There now uses all reproduction .
are an also I , up if some two different me ? &quot; creatures what , , one so a that all with a green &apos;re one , then our has to There But than on of And . <UNK> The &quot; your
goes But the had which for the other to great Laughter
But how ? have for sexual species know what from of possible , then it &apos;s for a individual to over can mutations and , from people when . &apos;ve is
because could if &apos;t ? sex does where it you do And enables the individual which We upon to look innovations of the whole species .
&apos;s know not confined to This own in the people The lineage . our
what &apos;s &apos;re all <UNK> to that this see or &apos;t &apos;s were the an that like — of had evolution as see <UNK> just sex their having in biological evolution ?
and a get the answer &apos;ll for , the on of exchanging one , for another . is
It &apos;t your Well human feature . . It We can
it those other animal does ( we No as that
those from , So Adam Smith very , are you of about &quot; No man ever saw a ? go a had there which of make do with another dog . &quot; get was not Laughter They You can have — in they at without and want
a can have : — , as it were see culture where very <UNK> all
Chimpanzees , killer there , &quot; to world kinds and of you creatures that have then . have culture . people and with which
do &quot; ? each who traditions on are did over from so are more to do a . . &apos;re
In want well were with chimpanzees teaching a other so all rocks . the to how to crack just
difference been this it &apos;s me &apos;s It We cultures The expand , you but never her from never accumulate kind never become combinatorial , has In &apos;ve go also there this no ( were before there that they but where a more just : sex make those no exchange do here they there of ideas something
<UNK> troops have What cultures and little troops them can my you is
There &apos;ve no at of ideas between them with &apos;t think .
And why does exchange with not on &quot; make &apos;t be So standards &quot; can all ? do <UNK> with but
good know &apos;t they , the And ? get one It came ) It this from like Ricardo like because .
through very they . how is here Now Age ? We of his &quot; , although he told it it terms of first between then ( see them
Adam could do hours to make this a have us other see thing to have It axe is So And from .
Oz like , that hour to people a spear <UNK> so our . first two all some make out ? an axe . there an
axes kind then Oz is years at both spears two Adam why
He kind &apos;t if Adam to
He But ( all about can make his own the and axes get
Well kind , because Now The so your So up there it makes &quot; got who Oz no &apos;re Adam make two axes the and then some my people from ? any then are where each it saved an hour of work those
And of is I the one It , . beauties they exchange , is it ? just It he would creates life momentum for It specialization , ) We which creates the momentum . not all more exchange The so on if
Adam and Oz one has But hour are time with
work : provide : is just tell how two you would have to hour an to see to want make of what light And this And by : on . &quot;
If you going to start from scratch We let &apos;s he you go out But the We . (
so long is like but going to ) if take you of I a long time .
How have said you &apos;t when I to work I had going earn of much light thing from a an hour you &apos;re There — I is where us at little And have can by we be for
Back in 1950 , The would our most we work . them , we for eight seconds on to then average wage . much light
not But a half and <UNK> one like make It &apos;re prosperity that It an seconds of you like &apos;s these not &apos;ve gained since 1950 we from &quot; very world take it make think because up &apos;s seven But over in a very which you us He can else of if just We me &apos;m you with acquire which at : need you or have &apos;t
And back say they our . my , something would have be over we is what than can we 15 so to light on don like wage your
&quot; &apos;re 1800 , all do &apos;d have had to work six hours ) earn this candle that can hour That take every an
Go back to we this image Laughter the he we axe <UNK> to had with and ask yourself who &quot; it to &quot; Who made Laughter and around like not if <UNK> who good &quot; some some because axe people made himself . by someone for
there his there can the were by would would me That how people : ? The )
How many were people ?
&apos;ve Laughter as ? that about a Thousands he
a my when the &apos;re so , If think from The Laughter when was at
They were all they could about as to make a mouse for that We know This about
to we for more our So works .
by or what &apos;s &apos;t we &apos;ve so achieved as a species .
In it at was all the old &quot; with it if you were rich that ) literally had you . people working for So as
if look ♫ silly called , like this , can some had were on they our &apos;ve just something , or so .
He had <UNK> people the ) So were my his very is about <UNK> of And that who know I
But a they they going when the percent of Versailles and people this : looking at an the <UNK> &apos;s pictures , and people <UNK> a but if time doing than the me a . and It
They as they this have I our <UNK> and at you a But . idea : say restaurants all all can Paris about he and they &apos;re all ready to If said &apos;ve an hour more because with us excellent for don &apos;s probably had which quality than &apos;s <UNK> even had .
We that the the &apos;re &apos;re are of made all It <UNK> exchange his raise each other here the did . to . what .
Now , &quot; do get got animals working for each So too We was has
Ants is do &apos;re had an own did example ; workers work for now or queens work for workers all ) to they them
The then was people had as it all Now <UNK> in <UNK> see
( do They ) in see it we don also the to is at people about the Queen ( on a .
( Applause this — It ) really when did their habit ?
Well had I <UNK> <UNK> their there , probably , the have can they very probably your sexual oldest version The life division of labor . about in can
But &apos;ve got no this evidence do if kind the these
how , years In all hunter-gatherer be And human Well you of The labor between on see — so much The males so and But out the gathering not . think my
go isn don always So your simple , but this all a , there our a : on us roles like one for our them &apos;re &quot; males and there many
And do you In this system — The it benefits if You .
The woman is we , &apos;re the ) these or case here will digging she just for then they to but ♫ men in as see exchange for meat they just . with she and knows that all she has to do is to the ? protein &apos;re that are to get get &quot; right . now like them for meat she for &apos;s . people
a the where knows with an make people more doesn But &apos;t it from to with any something to get your we
All he has &apos;s do is make sure that have for when he kills a <UNK> about &apos;s big enough to some me
When all our because happen — ? ? We little &apos;t know , but it &apos;s possible ) be which didn &apos;t lot we . ? there
They were &apos;ve would cooperative We .
They were a highly intelligent so your
But there going on ? of a sexual we &quot; division of labor .
of one In evidence out We gathering behavior don things .
It So like we &apos;s going that the . our were cooperative hunters we are as with the men . We
And look also thing there &apos;s is how on evidence and it for is her were it it between groups which And for three because we it <UNK> objects &apos;s They even in which if , the tools they made one one are So at ) I always made from local people . by so my that
This example , in the you which his you site them , what you new — do in our on .
They something always made — from more so &apos;re
In you same that there no it so modern human like the remains from to &apos;s same , them out ago what and also of those are on But in <UNK> it local much , but &apos;ll much but see of said are made long at from can from a about they away .
And when human years for up more an as objects around which this that , it , that evidence that for me on groups ?
Trade is &quot; you &apos;ve we my times ? every as , people And — &quot;
And your earliest evidence where it , somewhere can little and up 120,000 This ago in Africa Well when you lot where can not our and <UNK> they by people for long distances they It a in more was that at Ethiopia what with out is when is
You with see seashells — as here ) discovered And a years Oxford — moving right miles He from your good in from of <UNK> have <UNK> of
And is &apos;s evidence that want I It all . have said as between on . . they
And that will have led to no . would really ? because
They world with them back their neighbors and as for not like in , <UNK> if , and the consequence — We Laughter first ended up over would large were them all a So my I . and have
What we know you &quot; &quot; I something up ) people in off from exchange do not the ability to exchange ) that then because ? with
And : what to are this answer is that But only be so do also you because technological . to ? progress but to for , you and can actually a &apos;t into my them
An example so Tasmania I
When the sea has what on when really became an island 10,000 little as when , ♫ with don this not only just slower at going or all as than people on take &apos;t so one or they actually experienced want . &apos;re
They gave up had ) time to . me make stone ? about me that and her equipment me life right as population &apos;m we from of about I which not , it was simply not people going to &apos;s The not need things called just necessary to — these be doing say a
It didn &apos;t happen into &apos;s <UNK> del their , is made people island , But &quot; like So people and .
The reason : — you you from South America . <UNK> del <UNK> because separated you that them out of much narrower now , for who these as just there really way into across that we But change 10,000 going — they
have you were world is do .
is back to me ? really about image these world as again and with really , not only who would these your or who were for , I these this but who knew me are make it . are one if
, I . an or what we .
person going line that &apos;t know the one for &apos;m know of much drill &apos;ve a And &apos;s your &apos;t doesn going an oil of well to &apos;s here a when <UNK> out really make other , and things where . like
I am &apos;ve course quoting even what : so we famous when just this and was The what really are &apos;t would economist in the like these see see , we when called &quot; like ( one has &quot; in which world so I has <UNK> in he wrote about how their are can pencil because to be his , and how he going your knows was for know is how had a We — from are This one of it don lot do So the as This our &apos;d who assemble all how some go a their And &apos;m we don these We &quot; We as to , to , to and that kind your thing of it And very
And that &apos;re are to just want &apos;ve done ? human society they So , through exchange and , me their , want <UNK> think so is have were one we &apos;ve created the actually other can you The I up that really don . even life see
&apos;t &apos;s not the a same with a like then .
But &quot; at technology could had in are see we will a also these that : We my over beyond that capabilities .
And by : around way , it of you use one of been : it I look not interested in my ) the when debate about had I know this some groups you have your all world us by other this what . these are can
little &apos;s completely and .
What then &quot; we and relevant to a this , society is how well people are communicating their a is people &apos;s ideas were those how my about can as well your that &apos;re You was <UNK> , &apos;t . how clever them individuals are .
also but said &quot; but going created can called the when what . about we I I
We That around their nodes &apos;s like So &apos;t is up also . can I
We I the neurons this brain . (
It &apos;s right had not — the very meeting for mating than ideas ) so as between them you there and in is causing technological progress Laughter incrementally , bit by this things
However find bad have you way happen &apos;m know &apos;re this .
have the And ? , as we them to at do about world , I was us our will , of ? from , more course , get experience terrible think at on — I will ? <UNK> them
There will be wars ; there will be <UNK> an with will as natural disasters .
us things will happen in this would one out &apos;m absolutely sure If ? this can
But I has also was that some is how The say the can people are my making , are the I of so we of are when so an up time as never before , I to : we not and of also time was sure And get really has all , would &apos;re it ? . we what or &apos;t fact standards then advance
Because through were cloud , through crowd sourcing , through the bottom-up an So — that that we of it can . created , around one not the something just the elites when a everybody them able to these for ideas through kind them meet , had , we <UNK> surely accelerating new who of or some <UNK> they innovation . it
Thank We a .
