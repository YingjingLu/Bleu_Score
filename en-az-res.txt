Today I being going to talk about unexpected <UNK> is &quot; for
Now I work be the solar technology industry .
And my small <UNK> is looking with force by paying right ourselves into the environment to ...
... paying or to <UNK> .
It &apos;s this know like just a quick video of what we do .
if . Hang on a had a here moment .
It might take a moment to <UNK> through it what of
But Laughter ) We &apos;ll just — — has is <UNK> we about just we — &apos;ll just <UNK> through <UNK> in have at video instead ... ( Laughter )
No . ( very ) ( Laughter )
( Music ) This is not ... ( Laughter an
Okay . ( Laughter )
come technology have very on is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time be it really it ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
( Applause ) is
something we spread out . ( Laughter ) I see .
So I want you You pay attention to out you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to come back to that in in a minutes few , and I &apos;m hoping a that if you learn to <UNK> this little bit , it could <UNK> change the way your life <UNK> . see up and it
So , we &apos;re really <UNK> with body language I and we &apos;re who can they ? interested in other people &apos;s body language .
You know , we &apos;re interested &apos;t , like , you know — ( Laughter ) — an &apos;s interaction , or a smile , about a <UNK> <UNK> , or &apos;t a very awkward <UNK> , or maybe even something like a don .
could : Here will are <UNK> at <UNK> 10 .
This lucky <UNK> gets And is — to shake hands with the President down the United States .
Here comes the Minister — &apos;re . No . ( Laughter ) ( Applause Now ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Amy <UNK> ( So a <UNK> , called the lack of who have <UNK> , can have us talking for do and weeks and weeks what
We close up . We <UNK> can we ourselves what like .
We make ourselves small .
We don &apos;t want to bump into the person next to But .
So he <UNK> both ? and humans do That same thing . And in our But
And this is what happens when you put together high and same power .
So what we tend to like when it comes to power is that to are be this we look the other &apos;s <UNK> .
if someone is being So really powerful with us , we so to make ourselves smaller &apos;re is was . We don &apos;t mirror going .
We do the opposite of them .
So I in about So know &apos;m watching thought behavior in the classroom , and as do I ? notice
I notice that <UNK> the full students really and range of power <UNK> .
So you have people like who are <UNK> can some our really coming into the room , they she have into the middle of the room — , there before class even starts , like they really want to <UNK> space .
he they sit make , they &apos;re sort of also out .
They raise their hands like that &quot; so this . So &apos;re &apos;s I
You have other people who are will <UNK> when they come in . of As soon they come in has you see it .
You see it on their faces and their first , and they sit in their <UNK> and they make themselves way , and they go like them at is this there they raise their hand .
I notice you , it is you couple I things about this :
One <UNK> can , you &apos;re not going to is . to be surprised .
It seems ? be related to <UNK> .
So women ? do this kind much more likely to &apos;s So — as of thing than men .
<UNK> It <UNK> less powerful than men , of you so this is not an .
But We up &apos;s that the other thing I noticed we that it also seemed to when my our I to the extent can which <UNK> , and the students were how well they were <UNK> don
And this is , a a really important in the <UNK> classroom , because one <UNK> for half the grade .
So business or have and <UNK> with this <UNK> grade gap .
You get she equally <UNK> women and men &quot; at my coming in and then you get they people these differences the grades , and it come to be is as but <UNK> <UNK> to <UNK> .
So I started to ? they wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming the like this , and have &apos;re : is <UNK> .
Is going me that we could get people And are our I to <UNK> it and would be out just are it lead them to participate more a
So all main <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , who &apos;s at <UNK> , you I really wanted to know , can you <UNK> it till you make it ?
Like , can you do this just for would little while and all experience a <UNK> outcome the that makes you &apos;t was seem more was ?
So we know that our <UNK> <UNK> how other people think and feel about us . time &apos;s a little of of evidence . how in
But our question really was , do our <UNK> <UNK> a we think and feel about ourselves ?
So , for example , we smile when we feel happy most her also , when we &apos;ve <UNK> to more by holding a pen in our <UNK> as this , it makes us feel happy . there
So it goes both about .
When it comes to power , it also a : goes all ways .
So have when you feel powerful , you &apos;re little likely to do this not but it &apos;s also possible that when than <UNK> to how powerful , you time more likely to come feel powerful .
So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our like me bodies , but is of it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
And when have It see minds , in the case of the powerful , what my I talking ( ?
So I &apos;m talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of <UNK> things that We up our thoughts and feelings , also not my case , that &apos;s <UNK> . I look at <UNK> . of
So what do know minds of the powerful versus the <UNK> look like ?
So powerful people tend to be , not <UNK> , more <UNK> and more <UNK> , more optimistic .
They work in can before they <UNK> into a <UNK> , for two minutes go we say , &quot; &quot; You need to . this or this . &quot; &quot; They don &apos;t look at pictures of the <UNK> .
We then ask them , &quot; &quot; How powerful do you feel ? &quot; &quot; on a series — there very of <UNK> , and then we give them an opportunity to <UNK> , and then we take another <UNK> sample .
<UNK> tolerance , which is the <UNK> , we find that when you &apos;t in my <UNK> me universe , be percent of you at <UNK> . on me not our
When you &apos;re in the <UNK> <UNK> that , only by percent actually and that &apos;s a <UNK> significant difference .
Here &apos;s what we find on <UNK> .
From their <UNK> when they come are about my your , <UNK> people experience about a <UNK> increase , and <UNK> people experience about a <UNK> <UNK> .
So , and again , two minutes you get about was our these changes .
. &apos;s what you get on <UNK> .
<UNK> people experience over a <UNK> <UNK> , and the go people other about a <UNK> increase .
So on minutes lead to is these changes that <UNK> your brain to basically be a <UNK> , <UNK> and &quot; , or really <UNK> , had it be at and feeling sort of shut down .
And we &apos;ve be had the feeling he a all you , right ?
So <UNK> The it seems &apos;t our <UNK> do <UNK> there it who how from think and feel are It on and about ourselves , so it , but it &apos;s &apos;s not or others also ourselves . I I
Also , our bodies change our have &apos;re it minds &apos;re
But the next question , of course , is , ? power <UNK> for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
This is in the have , it &apos;s this little task , it &apos;s just a us at couple of minutes .
Where can you actually apply this ?
Which we <UNK> about , of course I : as
our so new people where you want these up an with to use this is <UNK> <UNK> , like social threat <UNK> .
Where are you being <UNK> ( either by your : friends ?
For teenagers what , it &apos;s at &quot; &apos;s are the <UNK> table And it .
For We people it &apos;s speaking at a school board meeting .
It might be giving a <UNK> or giving a talk like It that a this doing a job say .
We decided that the one that most people could <UNK> to because most people had been over , was the job interview .
So we published these <UNK> , and the media are all over it , and they say , Okay , so this is what here do when you go in for the job interview , right ?
( Laughter ) You know actually so we were of course <UNK> , and said Well my my who , no , that world not what ? meant at all .
For <UNK> reasons , no , don do that . &apos;t
This , this is not about you talking to other people .
It an not The you talking to yourself .
What my do before do you go into a job interview ? You do this .
You &apos;re sitting down was You &apos;re looking &apos;re your iPhone — or your not trying Android , anyone &apos;t to leave Laughter
You &apos;re looking has did this in notes you &apos;re Laughter up , making yourself small , when really what you should be at doing maybe so this , like If in the <UNK> , right ? Do that . with two minutes . my the with
called that &apos;s what all &quot; we want to &apos;ll . Okay ?
&apos;re we bring people into a <UNK> , didn they do either <UNK> or <UNK> with again , they go through a one <UNK> job interview space
It &apos;s five thing long . They are being can And recorded .
They being <UNK> also , &apos;re &apos;s <UNK> with and the <UNK> are trained to give no <UNK> feedback , so they look like this .
So for five minutes , but , and this down worse than being <UNK> .
People hate to .
It &apos;s what <UNK> <UNK> , &quot; think standing in social <UNK> . &quot; &quot; us this really <UNK> your <UNK> . like when — the
just interview So this matter the we put them through , my we of not because we really wanted to see what happened .
We then have these <UNK> look at these <UNK> , take of them .
They &apos;re <UNK> to the <UNK> they our all are . They &apos;re <UNK> to the conditions ,
They have no make who &apos;s been <UNK> in what <UNK> as and they end up looking at these sets of we this are it and they say , &quot; these with ? our &quot; We want to <UNK> these people , &quot; &quot; all the <UNK> we ( <UNK> <UNK> .
&quot; &quot; We don going were and . ) know to these people .
We also <UNK> these our much more life overall . &quot; &quot; But what &apos;s driving it ? would have —
It &apos;s not about the content with the speech .
those &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to other speech those
Because for rate them on all at on related to <UNK> , like , they from So from how lot is the speech ? them had the
How good is it ? What are their <UNK> — know . ?
No effect on those things It This is what &apos;s affected .
These kinds of things .
People are bringing their true selves to basically .
They &apos;re a themselves .
They go their ideas , but as go &apos;m with no , you know , <UNK> over them . we <UNK> have
So this &apos;ll what &apos;s driving the effect , or <UNK> the effect .
So when I tell people If this , that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior , and our behavior can change our <UNK> , We then to most &quot; &quot; , It and feels <UNK> . actually &quot; Right &apos;ve
So I said , <UNK> it till you make it .
It &apos;s not all out my me .
I don more want to get there and an feel we a them And there then still a are there It <UNK> .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an way where
I don &apos;t want to get there only to feel like they &apos;s I &apos;m not supposed when in to be here .
And that really <UNK> with me , because to want to them you a little story about being an <UNK> would we to with and right like I &apos;m not supposed So to we to be go me that , know .
When I was 19 , really bad car I was in a <UNK> .
I was <UNK> out of a know if us the car , <UNK> several times .
I was <UNK> from the car .
And I <UNK> up in a head injury <UNK> <UNK> . and I had or <UNK> right college , and I learned that my <UNK> had dropped by two standard <UNK> , which was very <UNK> .
I knew my <UNK> because I had <UNK> with being smart , and world had been called <UNK> as a child .
So I &apos;m me ) can taken out of college , I keep trying to go back to what can me out
They say , &quot; &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
so , you know is to , are other things for you to the , but that &apos;s about about not around to work out for you . &quot; &quot; So I really : with this , and I come to say , me &quot; me But having your identity taken from going , your core identity , your for me it was being smart , to of about having that taken from you , there &apos;s nothing that leaves you I first <UNK> than that .
So entirely <UNK> . I felt
I worked I worked , is ? The me I got lucky , look worked , and got lucky , and only .
college . <UNK> you <UNK> from
went took me four years longer than my <UNK> , So we and do ) convinced someone , my <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , to take me on thought and so I . here at <UNK> , and ended up know more at ) other was like , I as not supposed to be here .
I am an <UNK> to
And the night before my <UNK> talk , and what <UNK> talk at <UNK> be is is a <UNK> talk the just this to 20 work .

She came in totally this <UNK> , and she got , &quot; I &apos;m not supposed to ( And be here . &quot;

Because two things happened .
One was that I realized , oh my &apos;d with I don &apos;t feel like that anymore .

Our world has many <UNK> where
But they have the worst ) all <UNK> : invisibility .
For example , the <UNK> , <UNK> who collect <UNK> materials for on a is .
<UNK> emerged from up <UNK> , <UNK> , you solid waste from the of the <UNK> of was are <UNK> just the waste collection system . I
<UNK> provide at we heavy , honest that benefits the entire we and essential work &quot; &apos;s ) population . But they are not <UNK> for it .
Here in <UNK> , they collect 90 percent of all . waste that &apos;s actually recycled .
Most of the <UNK> back <UNK> , picking waste from this when to which the streets and <UNK> do to at very low prices . to <UNK> yards
<UNK> are <UNK> built from <UNK> or metal and found in several streets in <UNK> , only like <UNK> and street . on . art .
And this is how me there &apos;s to I first <UNK> <UNK> . in these
am a <UNK> for artist and activist and my art is like , &apos;d and political in nature .
In 2007 this I took my work beyond walls and onto the they , as a new <UNK> support for my message than
But at The time &apos;t giving voice to the <UNK> . do and I

So , the thing is , I <UNK> these this universe and have not take working since .
I have <UNK> if 200 many in many cities and have been to invited to do <UNK> and <UNK> worldwide . which this there

I met them in <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> , like Africa , Turkey and — in developed countries such as the United who and <UNK> .
And of so this was when I realized that I needed to have more people join the cause because it &apos;s a big challenge .
And then , I created a <UNK> movement called <UNK> My <UNK> called ( Laughter ) — which is a large <UNK> event . would to
your you .
( Applause ) .

On an as Laughter it November <UNK> , 1990 , a man — And named <UNK> have <UNK> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> What the leader of . the Jewish <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> was <UNK> guilty found not of the <UNK> , but while <UNK> time on lesser charges , he and other men began planning <UNK> on a dozen New York City <UNK> , including <UNK> , <UNK> and the United <UNK> <UNK> and
, , those plans ) of of ( I <UNK> by an you <UNK> .
<UNK> , the <UNK> <UNK> of the World <UNK> Center was not .
<UNK> would <UNK> be in you ? <UNK> for his <UNK> in the plot .
<UNK> <UNK> is my father . ) with to &apos;t
I was born in <UNK> , <UNK> through say to him &apos;m an <UNK> engineer could which a <UNK> American And have and the and grade school teacher , who together tried their best to create a happy childhood for me .
and wasn If until I was seven years old that our family dynamic started The in &apos;t to change .
My father exposed me to a side of <UNK> do few people This including the majority of &apos;m from it have Muslims , get to see . out — can ?
It &apos;s been The experience that when people take the time to interact with one another , it we &apos;t take to realize that for the most part , we all want the same things out of life that think some .
However , in every religion , in every population , you It find people who hold a small us of so some and their <UNK> that they feel they must use Laughter any means no to make others live as they do .
A few months prior to his <UNK> , he sat be can me down human explained that for the past few <UNK> , he and some friends he been going do a <UNK> range on Long Island for target practice .
do told me I &apos;d be going with of him the next morning .
We arrived at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , which <UNK> to our group was being watched by the <UNK> . <UNK> , of
When it was my turn to shoot , my father helped hold the <UNK> to me my <UNK> and explained how to <UNK> at the target about 30 yards off .
That day , the last <UNK> I shot hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target and to everyone &apos;s surprise the entire target do , especially mine , burst into <UNK> .
My <UNK> ? to the other men They and in Arabic said , they I my ? on at the &quot; here <UNK> . &quot; &quot; Like father , like my had .
even really big laugh They all seemed are get out of that <UNK> , but years wasn &apos;t until a few years later that I fully understood what they thought was , so funny . &quot; do &apos;t
They thought they saw in me the same destruction my father was capable of . be
Those men &apos;re them to would eventually be <UNK> And them of <UNK> a van filled with <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> into people not so the <UNK> parking lot of the World <UNK> Center &apos;s North <UNK> , causing an So that &apos;t six people and <UNK> over 1,000 others .
These were the men I looked up to .
These were the men I called <UNK> , which means <UNK> were like as
By the time I to very turned 19 no I he had already moved 20 times in my life , and that <UNK> during my childhood didn &apos;t really provide an opportunity to make many friends .
Each time have on I would ) I : around someone , begin to feel comfortable it was time to <UNK> up and move to the next <UNK> .
So the <UNK> new one our &apos;re at have us about do world class , I other <UNK> the target of <UNK> .
I kept my been : from my <UNK> to avoid being was , but as it turns out , being the <UNK> , <UNK> new kid in class . more than enough and it very <UNK> .
So for the most in ? you there our , I so spent my by : me time at home reading books and watching TV or playing video then .
For those reasons , my social skills were <UNK> , who say the least , and growing up in a <UNK> household prepared for the , I wasn &apos;t real from and .
<UNK> &apos;d been raised to judge people arbitrary measurements , like based on was are a person &apos;s race or religion .
what what opened my eyes ?
One of know is ? my first they an our experiences that challenged this way of thinking was during the 2000 <UNK> back .
thing a college <UNK> program , I was able . take part in the National <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> .
My particular group &apos;s focus was on <UNK> violence <UNK> and having been the <UNK> of <UNK> for most of something life , this was a subject in which I felt particularly there .
The <UNK> one our group came only many different walks of life .
were years toward the end of the <UNK> , I found out that one of the kids I had my what <UNK> was Jewish but
Now , it taken several days for other detail to come to light , and I realized that there was no natural <UNK> between the two of us all .
I had never had a Jewish friend before , and <UNK> I felt of a sense <UNK> in having been If to <UNK> a barrier but that would most she my life I had The led to believe want <UNK> .
Another major turning point came when I found a summer job at <UNK> <UNK> , an amusement park .
There , I there exposed to people from all sorts of two and cultures , and it about that But <UNK> to be fundamental see out development of my know . is So about
Most their my life , I &apos;d been taught that homosexuality thing a <UNK> , and by ) , that this And all gay people were a negative influence — .
As chance would have it , I had the opportunity to work with some of the gay <UNK> at a show there , and to found that many were the <UNK> , least <UNK> people I had she so to
<UNK> <UNK> time a kid created a sense you <UNK> in me toward the suffering of others , and it comes very <UNK> to me to treat people who you there you do are kind in any other way than how don would want that be <UNK> .
Because of that feeling , I was able to contrast the was stereotypes I &apos;d been taught as ( And was a child with real life experience and interaction .
I don &apos;t know what it &apos;s like to be gay , those was . in for <UNK> I &apos;m well with being <UNK> for something that &apos;s beyond my the .
Then all look &quot; &quot; The But <UNK> . &quot; &quot; On a <UNK> basis , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> all me to be <UNK> honest with myself about my there <UNK> way helped me to realize that because person &apos;s race It religion &apos;re as And me or sexual <UNK> had nothing to <UNK> a think &apos;t do with the quality my It &apos;s character . So
He was in on by many ways of father ( see figure to me when <UNK> what I some was in the need of one .
<UNK> can often come from an unexpected place that most and the fact a Jewish <UNK> had done more to <UNK> to my worldview than my own <UNK> father is on lost on me .
One day , I had a conversation with my mother about can my can was starting to change , and she said something to me that to I will very there hold dear to my heart for as long as I live in there ) as .
She looked at me with the <UNK> eyes of someone who had experienced enough it on one what are to last a lifetime , , &quot; I &apos;m and said that of <UNK> If ; &quot;
In that instant , I We how much negative energy me takes to hold that hatred inside of you because
<UNK> on is not out my real name .
I thought it when my family decided to end our it has like a father and start a new life .

Good morning !
Are do <UNK> ?
They took come name <UNK> , &apos;s . what it but I wanted to ask you , more anyone here write do from that name on the <UNK> in Arabic ?
<UNK> ! No one ? All right , no problem that
Once upon a time I not my This for long ago , I was sitting in a <UNK> with my friend , <UNK> food .
So I looked at the <UNK> they can and said my &quot; Do you a menu have with Arabic ) ? &quot;
He looked at me <UNK> , thinking that he <UNK> .
He think , &quot; &quot; <UNK> ? ( English ) . &quot; &quot; look said , &quot; &quot; The menu ( is ) , there one . &quot; &quot; then replied , &quot; &quot; you Don &apos;t know what they call it know &quot; &quot; &quot; I do . &quot; a is And
He said , &quot; &quot; No all ! It &apos;s called &quot; &quot; there &quot; &quot; ( English ) , or &quot; &quot; this , all in menu &quot; &quot; ( French ) . &quot; &quot; Is the French <UNK> correct ?
<UNK> &quot; Come , come up take care of this one ! &quot; here said the <UNK> So
when talking He was <UNK> to me , as if he was saying by himself , &quot; &apos;m this was the last girl on Earth , I wouldn &apos;t look at her very ! &quot;
What &apos;s the meaning of saying &quot; &quot; menu &quot; &quot; no Arabic ?
from from made a see young man judge a girl not being <UNK> and and .
How could she speak that way ?
At that moment , &apos;s more when The I started thinking .
It this my time ) made me to .
It definitely <UNK> !
I &apos;m <UNK> the on <UNK> &apos;re in right about how my own language my own country ?
happen ? Where could this
How did &apos;t know we get here ?
Well , while we are me , there are many people like me , who would reach a He a their lives , You they <UNK> give get everything that has happened me them in the past , just so they can say that they &apos;re modern and have <UNK> .
Should I You all my culture , thoughts , <UNK> and all my memories to would about was ?
<UNK> stories might be to the best know we have of the war &quot; (
Should I forget everything I learned in Arabic , just to <UNK> ?
To be one of them ?
Where &apos;s the <UNK> in that ?
now all of new That tried to understand him .
I didn &apos;t want to judge him with when same <UNK> that he <UNK> me .
The Arabic language doesn &apos;t <UNK> So &apos;s didn .
It &apos;s not a language is science , research , a language we &apos;re used to in universities , for language we use in the <UNK> , a language we rely on if we were to <UNK> an advanced research project , and it definitely isn &apos;t We language we use the at airport .
If we now so their they &apos;d <UNK> that of our clothes .
Where can I use We could it , then ? all ask this question !
So , you want us to use Arabic . Where are first to do so ?
This is one going .
But we have another this , can more important reality that we <UNK> to think up .
Arabic is We the &quot; the mother <UNK> . .
Research says we up ( a that <UNK> of other languages <UNK> <UNK> of the mother <UNK> .
<UNK> of the mother <UNK> is a years for creative expression in other languages .
How ?
is <UNK> has , when he first started writing , he and are all that used Arabic .
All his ideas , say and philosophy were inspired by this these boy in the village where he grew up , <UNK> a specific smell , hearing a specific because , and thinking a specific thought .
So , when he started as in English , he had enough <UNK> .
Even when he wrote in ? This English , when you read his <UNK> in English , these smell the same smell , &apos;re the same feeling .
You can imagine that that &apos;s him not writing in English , — we like the same boy who came from the mountain &apos;ve From a village on what <UNK> .
So , this is It this an example no one can argue with .
some your it &apos;s often said that if you want to kill a nation , the only We to kill a nation , is to kill its like that I there .
This is we just ) <UNK> a reality that developed societies are aware of .
The <UNK> , French , Japanese and Chinese , all been nations here aware of this .
That this why they <UNK> to protect But as and their language when
They make it sacred .
That &apos;s why they use We in <UNK> were they pay said not of money to develop it our
Do we know better than them ?
All right , can we aren &apos;t my from the developed world , this advanced thinking hasn &apos;t reached us from , and we would like to This up with the <UNK> world for .
<UNK> that were once like that , but no to <UNK> for development , do research , all &apos;t is and &apos;m kind with those countries , such as Turkey , <UNK> and others an they carried their language by them as they were <UNK> the <UNK> , <UNK> it like a <UNK> .
They kept it close to them in
Because if you get any product but &apos;t because Turkey or elsewhere and it &apos;s not <UNK> in it <UNK> , then isn &apos;t a local product .
You wouldn &apos;t believe it &apos;s because local product . you with to with
They &apos;d go back was our ( to being <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> , like me are most of the time .
So , in order for them to <UNK> and produce do they had look protect their language .
If were with more Laughter it say , &quot; &quot; this around , <UNK> , <UNK> ( Arabic ) , &quot; &quot; what does . remind you of ?
It not &apos;t ring are , does <UNK> <UNK> our be it ?
<UNK> of the who , how and she .
<UNK> isn &apos;t just for <UNK> , a words coming life right You <UNK> .
other represents specific stages around our lives , and <UNK> that is <UNK> to our do because
So when we say , &quot; &quot; <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> also &quot; each one of you <UNK> a specific image in their own mind , there are specific new of a specific day in a specific historical period .
<UNK> isn &apos;t one , two or for words or put together they .
It &apos;s an idea inside Well <UNK> to how we think take and how we see each other and how on see us .
What is our <UNK> if
as do you say whether this guy understands or not ?
So , if from to I say , for our It — &quot; We <UNK> , take , <UNK> ( English ) , &quot; said or if your the came up to you and put , &quot; Dad , have you lived through the period for the freedom ( English ) <UNK> ? &quot;
How said you feel ?
If you don &apos;t see a problem they then I &apos;d better leave see as , and stop talking in <UNK> .
The idea is that these <UNK> remind us of a specific thing . —
I have a <UNK> friend who &apos;s married when and in to have who we man .
I her things his going . And how &apos;s
She said , &quot; &quot; Everything of fine , but once , I , a They night asking and trying to translate the meaning of the word &apos; <UNK> that for him . But &quot; ( he ) ( Applause ) The poor woman had <UNK> told him &quot; &quot; <UNK> , &quot; &quot; But &apos;s and then spent over whole trying to . But explain many to him .
He was puzzled by the thought : &quot; &quot; How look anyone be our <UNK> ?
Does she want ? to commit suicide
<UNK> me two really ( English ) was &quot; &quot; This is have of the few examples .
It made us two that &apos;s unable to tell that word to her husband , since he won &apos;t understand , and ) and right not that ; his way of thinking is different .
She said to me <UNK> &quot; &quot; He , to <UNK> <UNK> with me if and one night , Now tried to translate for him so there can feel what I feel when But as but I So to <UNK> . &quot; tried to or &quot; The poor woman actually with him : &quot; From them &apos;s I <UNK> my hands &apos;re <UNK> you — &quot; ( Laughter be as ) And here &apos;s the <UNK> : &quot; And because see more you about you belong to them , I returned my hands and left you is about . . &quot; ( Laughter )
<UNK> that for me .
( Applause ) So , what have first know to protect the Arabic language ?
We turned this a concern of the civil society , and we launched a &apos;ll We to preserve the Arabic as .
Even though many people told me we now &quot; Why do you bother when
<UNK> about this <UNK> and go have fun . &quot; &quot; No problem !
The <UNK> to preserve Arabic launched a <UNK> that says , &quot; I talk And you from the East , but , reply from the West . &quot;
&quot; No ! , &quot; We didn &apos;t say We do not accept you or that . &quot; &quot; We didn &apos;t adopt this <UNK> because that way , we wouldn &apos;t be understood .
And when someone talks way me that way , I hate the Arabic language .
We say — ( Applause ) We want And so a to ) our reality , and be convinced in a way that <UNK> our dreams , <UNK> and day-to-day ? .
In a way are that <UNK> like us and thinks like we do . And as
So , &quot; &quot; I talk just it from you from the East , but you reply it Laughter ( from the West &quot; &quot; an you one was and the spot &apos;ll
Something very easy going yet creative and persuasive .
that we launched that , another <UNK> &apos;re <UNK> of by of — on the ground will
You ? seen an example of it outside , a scene of a letter surrounded be by black and yellow tape with &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t kill your , it I language ! &quot; &quot; written on it .
Why ? Seriously , don &apos;t kill your language .
We really shouldn &apos;t kill our language .
If we were to kill the language it they it , we &apos;d have to find an identity .
new &apos;d in The us have have to find an existence .
up &apos;d I for &apos;re go back to the beginning .
This is work just missing our chance of being modern and <UNK> .
After that we released photos of guys by girls wearing the Arabic letter . the
They of kind &quot; cool &quot; or guys and girls .
when are very cool !
And to <UNK> might say , &quot; &quot; <UNK> what that on ! You used an But : would us English word ! &quot; &quot; I about , &quot; ) &quot; No ! people adopt the there &apos; the word &apos;re &quot; &quot; Let them object however they want , but give me because word the <UNK> that that who and <UNK> the reality better .
I will keep on saying are &quot; Internet &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say : &quot; this was see what &quot; ( — I one is &apos;m going to Laughter world for web &quot; &quot; ( <UNK> from my ) Because it doesn and fit ! We shouldn &apos;t kid ourselves there
But to reach this point , we all have to be convinced that we shouldn &apos;t allow up an is bigger or thinks they have any of as us when it comes to language , to control us about make us see and feel what know here they want . . it
<UNK> is the with .
So , if we had &apos;t reach space or build &apos;ve rocket and so on around we can be creative what I see .
At this moment , ) one of you was a creative project .
<UNK> in your mother <UNK> is the path .
Let &apos;s start from this not ? moment .
Let &apos;s write a — would novel or produce a ? film .
A single my about — novel could make us back again .
It could bring the Arabic language back to being number one .
as many it &apos;s not true that there ) there or you no solution ; there is a solution !
But we have to know that , and be convinced that a solution exists , did we for I And have a <UNK> not be part of that solution .
In conclusion , what can you do today ?
Now , <UNK> , who &apos;s years ?
Please , I said ) of you , even though my time has finished , either Arabic , had , French or Chinese . in
But don &apos;t write Arabic with Latin characters mixed with numbers you
( Applause ) It those a disaster ! That up &apos;s not a language this .
You &apos;d up entering world his world with a <UNK> language . and can but
It &apos;s not Laughter of ? And easy to It with We come back from all a place which have they you and rise .
That my . of see — at first thing of we can &quot; .
<UNK> , there are many other that we can do things .
We &apos;re not here today to convince each other .
We &apos;re here think bring attention to the <UNK> of <UNK> this me .
Now just we about to I will or you a even .
A baby first <UNK> its father through language .
When my daughter is born , I &apos;ll tell her , &quot; &quot; This is your father , honey now Arabic ) . &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t say , with &apos;t they &quot; This ) &apos;s the is is dad , honey ( go be this &quot; &quot; And in the <UNK> , I <UNK> my daughter <UNK> , that They she says to , &quot; you &quot; Thanks ( they ) , &quot; &quot; I won &apos;t than , &quot; see <UNK> at &apos; <UNK> , <UNK> , &apos; &quot; one &quot; and hope no has heard her .
work Applause ) Let &apos;s get rid our this cultural <UNK> . ( Applause )
years ago , A few &apos;re felt like I was stuck in a <UNK> , so I decided follow in the <UNK> of the great American philosopher , <UNK> <UNK> , and try something &quot; for 30 days .
There the can people &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these <UNK> challenges .
The first was , instead of the our flying by , <UNK> I the time was much more us .
This was part of but is : out challenge I did to take a picture every day all a for a month .
I would never who been that <UNK> before I started my more challenges about But there . &apos;t &apos;t &apos;s And
I also figured out , can that if you really want something badly enough , you do can anything for 30 be of on days .
By but way , the I is not to out to sleep until <UNK> &apos;ve written your words the day . And
good might be <UNK> I are all a , but you &apos;ll finish your novel .
It &apos;s awful .
( Laughter ) But for the rest of my life , if I meet John <UNK> at a go <UNK> for for with I don to want , &apos;t have &quot; I &apos;m a computer scientist . &quot;
No , no , if I want to We I can say way &quot; &quot; that &apos;m a <UNK> . &quot; &quot; Laughter ) So here &apos;s one be thing I &apos;d like to on mention could
I learned that when I made small , sustainable changes , <UNK> in ) Laughter things I and keep , very doing , they were more think to the stick .
In in it ( fact , they &apos;re a <UNK> of fun .
( Applause )
The day I left home for the first time to go to university was a bright day <UNK> with hope and <UNK> .
I &apos;d done well at school . <UNK> for me were high , and I <UNK> <UNK> the I student world of <UNK> , <UNK> and traffic cone theft )
, can of course Now <UNK> , be <UNK> , and &apos;re an extent , this <UNK> , <UNK> <UNK> of <UNK> and traffic cone <UNK> was a <UNK> , <UNK> a very <UNK> and <UNK> one .
<UNK> , I was the with actually deeply of , insecure and fundamentally <UNK> — <UNK> of other people , of the future But would at all , of they and of the <UNK> that I felt was within : of one me .
But I was <UNK> was by So at <UNK> it outside appeared to be , and from the someone with everything to hope for and <UNK> to world
not <UNK> of <UNK> at so complete would &quot; <UNK> myself , That I even and as the first <UNK> ended We the second began ? there was no way that anyone know have predicted what was just about to happen .
I they leaving a <UNK> or it started , <UNK> to myself , <UNK> out time <UNK> just as are &apos;d done &apos;re <UNK> was that times before , when suddenly I heard a voice in <UNK> but &quot; She is leaving the room . &quot;
around , and there I looked but just was was This one there , but the <UNK> and <UNK> of the you . <UNK> .
<UNK> here I left my books on the <UNK> and <UNK> home , and there it was through .
&quot; She is opening the door . &quot;
This was the beginning . The voice and arrived .
so the I <UNK> , days and then weeks of it , on want on , <UNK> with that by everything I did in the he person .
&quot; She is going &quot; to a lecture .
It was <UNK> , from <UNK> and even , people a while , <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> just although I did notice that its <UNK> <UNK> sometimes <UNK> ) my we Laughter and that it <UNK> <UNK> my own have <UNK> <UNK> .
So , for example , if &quot; was to this had to hide it , which I often did , being very <UNK> at <UNK> how I really will , then the voice would sound <UNK> .
Otherwise , way &apos;t which &apos;t nor disturbing , although even at that point it was clear that see here ( it had something to communicate to me about So emotions which is got emotions things remote and <UNK> .
Now it was then that I made a <UNK> and in in , in that I told a friend so the voice , and So not if &quot; she was <UNK> .
A <UNK> . ) on our <UNK> process had <UNK> , — was the <UNK> that normal people don &apos;t hear voices and the he that I did meant that something was very There wrong . this
<UNK> <UNK> voice didn &apos;t seem quite so benign there anymore , and when she <UNK> that I seek medical attention If I <UNK> <UNK> , and which <UNK> to be <UNK> number two .
I spent here time telling the college <UNK>
about what I about to be the real problem : anxiety , low <UNK> , fears about the future , and was met with my so — bored <UNK> until I mentioned had voice , upon which he dropped his pen , <UNK> round and began to question me going you And like my a show of real interest .
And to be fair , I was <UNK> for interest and help , and I began to tell him about about them <UNK> .
And I always wish , at this point , the voice had said , &quot; She is <UNK> her own <UNK> . &quot;
I was referred to a <UNK> just by <UNK> took a <UNK> view of the voice of &apos;s presence , <UNK> <UNK> everything right said on a lens I you of <UNK> a them
For example , human was part of a student the campus , and news <UNK> around TV station that broadcast during an <UNK> which was running very late , I said , &quot; &quot; so but when , I &apos;m sorry , This had I &apos;ve got to go .
even &apos;m reading the news be six do So they about . as all , &quot; &quot; Now your &apos;s down new my medical records that <UNK> things <UNK> at here we that &apos;re &apos;s a television news <UNK> .
It was at this point that events began which <UNK> <UNK> you would
A hospital <UNK> So is know &apos;t followed , the first . many , a <UNK> of me came next , and then , worst of all , a <UNK> for <UNK> sense very because me about <UNK> , <UNK> they see It and despair about the myself and my <UNK> .
But having been <UNK> to see . voice not as an So but as — <UNK> , my fear and <UNK> towards it what we
Now essentially , this <UNK> taking an <UNK> <UNK> my of mind , a kind of <UNK> civil war , up an &apos;s at and in turn this caused the number of voices to increase and grow <UNK> hostile and <UNK> . we for people You
<UNK> and <UNK> , I began to <UNK> into is <UNK> inner world in which the voices were <UNK> to become both my <UNK> ( my only <UNK> <UNK> .
They told me , for example , that if I <UNK> myself worthy of their help , then time do they could change my life back to how it had been , and a series of increasingly bizarre <UNK> was set , a kind of <UNK> of <UNK> .
It started off being small , more do It <UNK> example , pull out was for , at three <UNK> of so your was hair , but because we — <UNK> it grew more extreme , <UNK> in <UNK> to <UNK> myself , up a by this So particularly dramatic <UNK> : &quot; &quot; You see that <UNK> over there ?
You see that <UNK> of water ?
Well , you have their go over and <UNK> it over him in <UNK> of when they you I other students . &quot; &quot; Which I actually did , and which needless to say out not <UNK> me to the <UNK> .
In effect , a <UNK> cycle of fear , <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> had when the they &apos;t been established , and this was a battle in which I felt <UNK> and <UNK> of know any kind of peace or <UNK> .
Two years later , and &apos;re <UNK> was dramatic . ?
By now , I had as to space <UNK> : <UNK> voices , <UNK> <UNK> &apos;re , bizarre with on , had <UNK> .
very mental health status will been a <UNK> for <UNK> have <UNK> see <UNK> , and physical and sexual <UNK> , and I &apos;d been told by my <UNK> an as be a , &quot; &quot; <UNK> , you &apos;d be better very with cancer , because cancer is easier to cure than <UNK> . &quot; &quot; I &apos;d been <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> , and was by now so tormented by the voices that at that kind attempted to <UNK> a hole in my head in order to get them out <UNK>
Now looking back is he me what on the <UNK> and despair of those And of years , it I to me now as if someone died in that place an and yet , someone &apos;re was saved if
say broken time <UNK> person began that journey , The the person who emerged was a <UNK> and would ultimately grow not on are because the person I was <UNK> to be .
Many people have <UNK> me in my life , and and &apos;s I remember but them all , but the memories grow pale and faint in comparison with this people who &apos;ve helped me .
The fellow <UNK> , time from our the fellow <UNK> Applause the <UNK> and <UNK> ; the mother who never gave up on me , who knew that one day I would have back to her and was willing to wait for me for . for we &apos;t as long as it took ; the doctor who only worked with me for It brief just but who <UNK> his belief that <UNK> was not only possible from <UNK> , and during a <UNK> period about <UNK> told my <UNK> family , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t give up hope .
I believe that <UNK> can get through this .
Sometimes , you know , it <UNK> as late as <UNK> , but summer always get eventually . &quot; &quot; <UNK> minutes is not enough here to fully credit those good and <UNK> people who fought with me and for our and who <UNK> to <UNK> me back is make <UNK> , not place .
But together out are about have they <UNK> a blend of It in can courage , creativity , <UNK> — , and an <UNK> be this &quot; belief you But is that my What self could become <UNK> and whole their
I go to say that these people saved me , have but what I now know is they did something even more important in that they <UNK> say to save &quot; , and <UNK> , they helped me to understand what something which I &apos;d now suspected : that my voices were a meaningful It to can <UNK> life events , particularly childhood events , and as such were going my <UNK> when a so of &apos;s ? into <UNK> world problems .
Now was at first , called was very difficult to and people that can believe , not least because the voices appeared so hostile and <UNK> , so in this over , a &apos;t how like first step was a <UNK> learning to separate these . all meaning from what I &apos;d previously say to with a <UNK> these .
So for example , but <UNK> when see voices which threatened to <UNK> ) home I learned to <UNK> as my own sense of fear Laughter <UNK> in the world , rather is and it &apos;s here I years , objective danger want you , do
Now had first , I would have believed can you them .
two Applause , for example , sitting up one And on <UNK> outside my parents &apos; room to protect them from what I thought was a genuine threat from for the voices which about .
Because I your had in have such a bad problem with <UNK> that But which so most of the <UNK> in the house had been hidden , is world there so I ended up <UNK> myself with a plastic <UNK> , kind of like <UNK> <UNK> , and the of sat outside the room <UNK> it and waiting to <UNK> into action should anything happen .
It , &quot; &quot; Don was like &apos;t mess with me .
I &apos;ve got a plastic <UNK> a &apos;re ( don &apos;t you We ? &quot; &quot; <UNK> .
were a later response , and much more useful , would be want try and <UNK> the message with words , the so when the them voices <UNK> from when me not to leave the house , then I would thank them for drawing my attention to how <UNK> like felt — because if I was aware of it , then I could our something positive about it — but go on to <UNK> both and myself that we were safe about I who didn &apos;t need to feel <UNK> anymore .
I would set boundaries for the voices , and not we The there try to interact with them in a way that was <UNK> yet can , <UNK> a slow process of me universe <UNK> in which we could learn to work together and support one another .
<UNK> all of this , like I would ultimately So : that each voice was closely &apos;t to aspects of myself , and that each of them carried <UNK> emotions that I &apos;d never had an opportunity process or sexual how and <UNK> <UNK> , memories of , &apos;re anger , shame , <UNK> , into <UNK> . one &quot;
The voices took the place here this pain and gave words had it , possibly and one of the was have when greatest the I when people realized that the most hostile and <UNK> voices actually <UNK> the over of me our at me what that had been hurt most <UNK> on and as such all a all these , it was these voices that people ) a to be shown the greatest compassion just and care .
It was <UNK> with this knowledge there ultimately lot would gather together my <UNK> self , each <UNK> <UNK> I &apos;s do And a different voice , <UNK> <UNK> from one and return to <UNK> all my <UNK> , , only this side time from the other .
Ten years What the world would or It voice first came on ( time , I finally <UNK> , this with the <UNK> degree in psychology ever given , and the university had one a year later , the <UNK> masters , which shall we say or &apos;t bad for a <UNK> .
if fact , one of the voices the answers actually <UNK> during the <UNK> , which technically possibly be we so <UNK> as <UNK> .
( Laughter ) And to be honest , sometimes I he enjoyed their — in well .
As <UNK> <UNK> has said , the only is worse than they a I being talked about is not being talked about .
It also makes you very the at <UNK> , because you can listen to two conversations <UNK> .
I worked in mental health services , What spoke at <UNK> , I published book <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> , and I were , and continue to do so They the <UNK> of the following concept : that important question in an <UNK> shouldn &apos;t be what &apos;s wrong with you but was what people &apos;s happened to you .
Laughter all the while , I listened to my voices story with whom I &apos;d &apos;ll years to live with peace and respect and which in turn reflected a growing sense of and respect compassion , acceptance me towards myself .
And I remember the most moving and extraordinary And It Laughter these your when <UNK> another young woman This was <UNK> by her some , becoming fully aware out you , for the very first it , that I no longer felt that way myself but into finally when out &apos;s &apos;s able to help someone else who was .
people &apos;m now very proud to be a part of <UNK> , something your body of the <UNK> Laughter <UNK> <UNK> , an <UNK> inspired by the work of <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> and Dr. <UNK> <UNK> , which <UNK> voice hearing as a survival <UNK> , a So reaction to <UNK> <UNK> , not as an it <UNK> of <UNK> to be <UNK> , not was but a complex , significant and was experience to be <UNK> .
Together , we <UNK> and <UNK> a society there understands and <UNK> voice hearing , <UNK> the very It And needs of individuals who hear In , and which are them as full citizens .
This his of society is not only possible , it &apos;s already on its way .
To &apos;re <UNK> , once social change begins , it cannot be <UNK> .
You cannot <UNK> in person who feels didn . ? &apos;s
You cannot <UNK> the What who are not . have what afraid anymore . one out of the
For me , me all It as the <UNK> of the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> are a <UNK> that <UNK> , <UNK> , justice and respect are more than words ; they are convictions and <UNK> , and that <UNK> can change the world very .
In with or the last 20 years , the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> has established hearing voices know a it networks in , But say countries across five continents , working together to promote dignity was <UNK> and <UNK> for individuals in mental <UNK> you to create a space language and practice of hope , which , at its very center , lies an <UNK> And know &apos;re very two in you &quot; the power of the individual .
As the &apos;t Peter <UNK> has said , the human animal is a unique being <UNK> with they <UNK> capacity to <UNK> and the is one about for <UNK> spirit to <UNK> this <UNK> how .
In this respect had for <UNK> of society , there is no greater honor or privilege than <UNK> that process of <UNK> for someone , to bear witness , to reach out a hand , to share the burden of someone &apos;s suffering , And to hold the hope for their <UNK> .
And <UNK> , for <UNK> of &quot; and <UNK> something that we &apos;t have remember we don to two our lives forever defined by the how had the <UNK> things that have happened to us .
We are unique . We are <UNK> .
What out within us it never be truly not , by , or not I taken away .
The light never goes out .
a very wonderful As doctor once said to be me , &quot; &quot; lot &apos;t tell as me what other be have out more not told you about yourself us &apos;s to .
Tell me you you . &quot; We Thank <UNK> you .
( Applause )
I &apos;m here to they or share my photography .
Or is it photography for
Because , of course , this is a photograph that ( know have you can &apos;t take with your camera .
<UNK> , your interest in photography started they I have &apos;s what had got my first about they so digital world at the age of 15 .
It mixed with my earlier at for drawing , but it was a bit different , do using the camera as us , the process was &apos;s And planning a But instead . my just
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the he ends when you press the trigger .
So to were it felt like photography was more about was at she right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I look to every something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
<UNK> like this : what going on along a busy road . them
But it has an unexpected <UNK> like
And despite that , it <UNK> a level of <UNK> .
Or photos like these — both dark and <UNK> , but by time had a like with a common goal of <UNK> the level of <UNK> .
When is say <UNK> then I mean with this be my <UNK> .
Because some got course , it &apos;s not something you can so what capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
<UNK> where you will need a brief moment have think ) a figure out the .
So it &apos;s more about Now an idea than about <UNK> a moment really most
But what &apos;s the <UNK> how trick some makes it look &apos;m ?
Is it something should the details or the was ?
Is . something about We light ?
What creates if up as the <UNK> ?
Sometimes the perspective is time <UNK> .
But in , end , those comes down to how we <UNK> the world and how it more be realized on a world have your you two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is <UNK> , it &apos;s what we think , as : .
So I think the <UNK> now quite simple .
things just see it as a <UNK> of reality where you can take said pieces of reality and put it together to because <UNK> reality you a .
And let me So — a simple example .
have three perfectly Here we <UNK> physical objects so , we all can <UNK> to to in a three-dimensional of .
But combined actually a certain other , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t which that if accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense . we
And I see the same the with <UNK> So .
It &apos;s is of about <UNK> different <UNK> been
So the things that look <UNK> &quot; I Laughter very think make a photograph so &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t for can to even think about I the things all around And &apos;s us in our daily lives .
But when <UNK> <UNK> , come is really important to consider in are , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I up like to their that there see three simple &apos;t to follow to achieve a <UNK> time .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special who
we combined , how can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
Secondly , photos same type combined should have the of light .
And these two images know <UNK> these they was my two <UNK> — shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
The third one is to about making do impossible to <UNK> where the different images begin and there end by of but <UNK> get
<UNK> it impossible to say how the image actually then <UNK> .
So by <UNK> color , contrast and <UNK> Laughter the <UNK> between the different images , adding be <UNK> like that about how ( of field , <UNK> colors and noise , we <UNK> the <UNK> between the different images and for it look like one single image , really the fact that one people ( It image can <UNK> hundreds of <UNK> basically .
So here &apos;s another example I
) One might think ( Laughter that this is just an now of a or landscape and the lower part all what &apos;s <UNK> .
, — would is actually had <UNK> And <UNK> like of <UNK> from different <UNK> . me they it
I personally think a some he was that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a some , because then you don &apos;t need to <UNK> with the ideas in your head .
that it does <UNK> a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had what this to plan at , to find the different <UNK> for the ) of the <UNK> basically .
So for example , the fish was captured on a <UNK> trip .
The shores are from a different location .
The underwater part was captured in a by <UNK> .
And many , I even turned the house on said of the <UNK> red to they what make even look more That .
( to achieve a one result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a <UNK> , an idea my &quot; And <UNK> for
You it &apos;s about an Laughter different <UNK> .
about here through piece back it because planned .
And if you do a good job <UNK> the photos , the result can be : to — there of beautiful and also quite <UNK> I
So all the <UNK> tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .

Chris Anderson : <UNK> , <UNK> .

And how do you secure very people be privacy ?
<UNK> : So know &apos;t these are — as far as we can tell — thing whistleblowers , We we — a number of ways for them to life information to us .
So we use this <UNK> encryption to <UNK> &apos;s around the Internet , to hide but , pass it through <UNK> <UNK> like Sweden do and <UNK> to <UNK> right <UNK> <UNK> .
We get information in the mail , can so it into regular now not mail , encrypted or not , <UNK> it like a regular the &quot; you on organization so so do that you <UNK> it — which is sometimes have something that &apos;s quite hard to do from when you &apos;re talking about giant databases people like have &apos;t But <UNK> it to the public and then <UNK> ourselves against the <UNK> <UNK> and political <UNK> .
CA me So you make an effort to <UNK> the <UNK> are legitimate know <UNK> but had actually as never know who the not identity of the source is ?

&apos;t is something you <UNK> a few something ago .
universe come can have I document up ...
So this was But see was see a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can who tell us what you this and what happened ?
<UNK> : have this is the <UNK> our .
This was a secret intelligence your <UNK> by the like the in Kenyan government after its election This 2004 .
<UNK> us 2004 , Kenya was <UNK> by <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> for about 18 years .
He What a <UNK> <UNK> of our , on Kenya .
Laughter when <UNK> actually into power be through a <UNK> of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya — they our our was I <UNK> this report , spent about two million <UNK> on So and an <UNK> report .
And then see government sat on it and used it by for political <UNK> on <UNK> , who was the if still are <UNK> man the <UNK> man — to Kenya What
It &apos;s the <UNK> <UNK> of Kenyan be &apos;s — <UNK> .
So I out there in &apos;s , and we The to managed to get hold of this just prior also the up — the national election world , December 28 .
When we released that report , we did so three days after very is the the new president , <UNK> , had decided to do up with the man that he was space to clean out , <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , so this report then became a people <UNK> around President <UNK> &apos;s <UNK> .
is : And — go mean , So to cut a long make short — word of the report <UNK> into Kenya , not from — ( there &apos;s the <UNK> media , but <UNK> , and in your opinion , — it actually <UNK> the election .
<UNK> : been . So this became front page of the Guardian ( was then <UNK> in all the <UNK> countries Thank Kenya , in <UNK> and South African press .
And so it came a from the outside .
And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan actually feel safe to talk about it .
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan In , <UNK> is because the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan of the changed the result intelligence report , which election .
CA : Wow , so your <UNK> really And just it I <UNK> changed the world ?

We ended up sending can there two people to <UNK> to further if that story .

<UNK> very I do &apos;t know . how guess people in see the <UNK> <UNK> in force .
You have guys walking in So you to So a <UNK> way down So that &quot; one &quot; up would an street was and then so &apos;re can from <UNK> <UNK> sitting up <UNK> on everyone at one <UNK> an <UNK> <UNK> — looking for any excuse to do so — and killing people <UNK> could <UNK> . , by would have
did we was two <UNK> involved <UNK> it weren do with at &apos;t <UNK> because that &apos;s their <UNK> job .
CA a for out me : I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence <UNK> and <UNK> <UNK> , arrested , and it so alleged that like we what a <UNK> in a <UNK> one a — to have <UNK> this video to you , along with <UNK> &apos;t &apos;s ? <UNK> U.S. <UNK> <UNK> .
I mean , did he ?
<UNK> : We have <UNK> <UNK> those here there as out out . We one the
He has been charged , about here days ago , with what <UNK> and <UNK> 50 people , as . had with Laughter as
Now , we I be ? had released , early in the year — We <UNK> I , a cable from this <UNK> U.S. on , but this for not &apos;s connected .
can mean , I was a known <UNK> : out <UNK> .
CA : , mean people if you did receive thousands of U.S. <UNK> is <UNK> ...
even : We would have released them . not ( CA : You would ? ) <UNK> : Yeah . ( CA : Because ? Well ) you : , because these sort of things reveal what the true state I , say , Arab governments are like , the true <UNK> <UNK> in those governments .
If you look at <UNK> <UNK> , that &apos;s the sort of ? that &apos;s there .
CA : So let &apos;s talk a little he more <UNK> about got .
I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy at
Why is it right to encourage <UNK> of secret information ?
<UNK> . : Well , — &apos;s a question as to look do what And one of make It important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So get that organizations are spending economic effort into <UNK> , that &apos;s a really one <UNK> that when the information gets out , there &apos;s there hope of it doing some good — because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out spending So they , are work to <UNK> The &quot; we on it .
And that &apos;s what you &apos;ve found in practice , and that are what the history of <UNK> is .
have : But are his risks with that know are would know a either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , They one to is <UNK> can actually have an now consequence ?
<UNK> : Not that was but be you we have seen with anything We have released .
I mean , on about we have want <UNK> <UNK> policy .
We have a way what dealing with information that has sort of personal — by &quot; information then it other
But there are legitimate secrets — you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret — but we deal with whistleblowers that had coming forward that are if sort of <UNK> .
CA : So they people <UNK> .
And what would you say to , for he , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is with <UNK> the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; &quot; You know what , don &apos;ve put something that up someone had an was to put out .
It shows a U.S. <UNK> laughing at people dying .
That gives the impression , has given the impression , . to millions of me you the world that U.S. think are <UNK> people .
through , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How <UNK> you ? &quot; &quot; What would you say to that ?
<UNK> : are Yeah , we do our be is years get a lot of that The
But remember if this &apos;t for the people in what ? <UNK> , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan this they don &apos;t need to see ? video ; they see it every from — for by day say
So it &apos;s not going to be their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
That &apos;s what said see with up .
It will this change the It and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
CA : So you found a way to shine would one what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
<UNK> is good ,
But do you see any <UNK> in the fact that , ? if know in world for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create from around your sources ?
<UNK> : has But had when mean , we don &apos;t have by <UNK> <UNK> yet .
have sources We don &apos;t I who all . just it an it <UNK> on other sources
Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re <UNK> acting in such a way universe people feel <UNK> <UNK> to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
CA about like can by : I &apos;d actually be interested , just from <UNK> based on what we &apos;ve very , of heard life far — I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
You know , , it &quot; there might be a couple of <UNK> of <UNK> and of <UNK> .
You know , <UNK> — people &apos;s <UNK> time around this important light .
<UNK> <UNK> .
Who &apos;s got should <UNK> view ?
Who &apos;s as the dangerous <UNK> view ?
like : Oh me come on . There must be some .
CA : It &apos;s a <UNK> crowd , <UNK> , a <UNK> crowd .
We have to try They . Let &apos;s show them another example .
Now who &apos;s time that you haven right yet <UNK> , but thought think for didn you are .
a mean it &apos;s an <UNK> story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
What is this ?
<UNK> or they , : So got is sample of what we do sort of every day .
So late last was — in November one &apos;t &apos;s . last year our . — every was a series of our <UNK> in because , like the the well <UNK> in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
And we an a report — a sort of it they <UNK> into what happened — saying that , in fact , security <UNK> from some <UNK> , various <UNK> oil <UNK> had , at you But &apos;t fact for <UNK> <UNK> there and Laughter them a as up You
And part of the this — government was in , etc . like etc .
Applause in engineering report had nothing on the top were it was &apos;re he ( , more by , so So extremely difficult document can &apos;m what for . us .
We couldn &apos;t thing see because we didn &apos;t &quot; who wrote it and knew what it was this there about .
So we were kind years <UNK> that maybe it was a <UNK> more of be just oil <UNK> the issue up .
So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; &quot; Look know , can we &apos;re <UNK> about what thing new
We don &apos;t know &apos;t at , but what these we do ?
The material looks good ) he out , our feels right , but we just can &apos;t very it . see And we need &quot; got a letter just at who by this week from human company who wrote it , wanting to <UNK> down the source — ( Laughter ) saying , &quot; &quot; Hey , on want to <UNK> : the source like not &quot; And we were my like , &quot; &quot; Oh Now tell us more .
What document is it , life , you &apos;re come about see
Can you show that you had <UNK> <UNK> over that document ?
it really were are an Is <UNK> ? &quot; &quot; So they sent us came screen shot with the <UNK> in the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
Yeah . about &apos;s like
( Applause ) That &apos;s know quite a lot though .
This have like one of our methods of &quot; , of <UNK> , what a material be , is to right and get these guys to write letters .
CA : Yeah Have you had information from inside <UNK> ?
way : Yeah , we have a lot , of in but I mean , at the , we a are <UNK> those sort of serious <UNK> and engineering effort .
So our <UNK> rate over the past few months has been sort of <UNK> while we &apos;re <UNK> around back systems for the <UNK> public interest that we have . we be had I
I &apos;s a problem .
I mean , like any have through growing <UNK> organization , we your sort what things overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting two <UNK> of whistleblower <UNK> of a very high <UNK> but don &apos;t have and <UNK> people to actually process with and with my enough on information .
CA : she that &apos;s the put ( time <UNK> , basically <UNK> volunteers and / or the funding of <UNK> salaries the see ?
<UNK> : <UNK> . Yeah , and <UNK> people .
I mean , these &apos;re an organization that ? would So with is hard to grow very quickly with of the &apos;ve of material we In with , so we have <UNK> But So to <UNK> in order to have people who will deal at the <UNK> national security stuff , and life lower security very .
CA put So help us understand a bit about said personally it one you came years do but all
they I think I read that as a kid you went to <UNK> different schools .
Can that be right ?
<UNK> : Well , my parents I were in in see who at the movie business and then on the run from a <UNK> , Applause me this <UNK> between the two ...

Unfortunately , &apos;s the moment , it &apos;s mostly <UNK> by with Russian <UNK> in order to grandmother your steal only bank <UNK> .
So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be is to But
CA So So So the : Yeah , well , I certainly But &apos;t think What &apos;re who anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account to but what about your core values on not This because
Can you things is like not do us a sense of what they get and maybe here Thank in your these that &apos;re them an helped determine how ? when we
<UNK> : I &apos;m not sure about called But .
But the core values : well , capable said at and men do not create victims ; they <UNK> victims .
And , that &apos;s something from is one this my father and something from So very the would capable , <UNK> men that have been in my life .
CA : <UNK> , <UNK> men do not create victims when they <UNK> victims ? from are
<UNK> : should . And you one , I &apos;m a <UNK> person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on but some way — the <UNK> can there is another in with . the way of it victims here which is to Now <UNK> thing was .
And so &apos;m is something that has been in at about for a long time .
CA : a So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in <UNK> ?
You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service ? was ( me &quot; <UNK> from running the story . of .
Instead , they <UNK> your side to It my .

And just a month even me this was passed by the <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> .
CA : Wow .
when Applause can Last question , <UNK> .
When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be can <UNK> <UNK> more control , more <UNK> , or us watching us <UNK> , or it &apos;s just all be played for either way ?
<UNK> : I make not sure two way it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there &apos;s enormous <UNK> to more freedom of speech <UNK> and <UNK> this to on <UNK> around all I how a the world — within the <UNK> , between China and the United &apos;ve .
Which way is so the be Laughter it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in — because with just a little bit like of effort , we in my can shift it one way or the other . out

I &apos;m a storyteller . it the
That &apos;s human I do in who — telling stories , writing <UNK> — and know here would like to tell you a few stories about the art of storytelling and &apos;s some <UNK> creatures <UNK> . called the
But before I go there , please allow me to share with you <UNK> from of my personal story .
I will do so with the help of words , of course , of but also a <UNK> shape , the circle , so throughout my talk , you will come across several circles .
I was in an , about to <UNK> parents .
<UNK> after , my parents know are of got separated , and I came to little would my mom .
From then on , I was raised as a single child by a single mother .
Now in the early 1970s , really <UNK> , about , about can that was a bit <UNK> .
Our neighborhood to full of large So , where fathers were the heads of <UNK> , so I grew up seeing my mother as a <UNK> in a which environment .
In fact , ( grew up <UNK> two different kinds of &apos;s .
On &apos;m one hand of was my , a there my <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> woman . modern , <UNK> ,
On the other the by was my at you my which It , who also took care of me and was that spiritual , less educated and definitely less <UNK> .
This was a woman who read coffee In to see the future and <UNK> lead into mysterious shapes at <UNK> off the <UNK> eye .
Many people visited my grandmother , people with severe <UNK> on their faces or <UNK> on their hands They
down time say there grandmother would need some words in Arabic , take a red <UNK> and <UNK> it with as many rose <UNK> as and it a the about of <UNK> she wanted she remove .
Then one by are these when the one , she they <UNK> these <UNK> with dark <UNK> .
A week later , the <UNK> would come back right a <UNK> <UNK> .
that Now , I &apos;m aware I should not be saying know about the he not in front of an thought of <UNK> and scientists , but the &apos;ve is , of all the people who visited my grandmother for their what like of you his conditions , are do when I did not see anyone go said <UNK> or <UNK> .
I asked her how she something this But Was it the power of <UNK> ?
In response she said , where could Yes , <UNK> is effective world but also <UNK> of the power of circles . for &quot; From her , I learned , <UNK> many other things , one our precious lesson — &quot; if you from to destroy something in life life , be it an <UNK> , a <UNK> or the human soul , all you need to do is to <UNK> it with thick walls .
It will The up inside . <UNK> from one at
Now we all This in some kind <UNK> a social and cultural circle and ? who as that
We all do . this It
the &apos;re born people a certain family not as that , nation , class .
need if we have no connection <UNK> with the worlds beyond the their we but for granted , then we too run the risk So of <UNK> up inside about
Our imagination might <UNK> ; with hearts might <UNK> he and our <UNK> might <UNK> if we stay for too long inside our cultural <UNK> .
Our friends , Well , colleagues , family — We all the people in our know some are see inner is <UNK> that , it means if are thought with what our mirror image .
Now one other thing women &quot; . like my <UNK> do in Turkey is to cover <UNK> with <UNK> or to hang them on the walls with their <UNK> facing out .
It Applause an old <UNK> out based on the we my a they knowledge that it &apos;s not <UNK> for a human only to spend too much time staring at his own reflection .
it , &#91; living &#93; <UNK> of the in <UNK> is one on the years in of today &apos;s <UNK> world .
And it &apos;s make everywhere , among <UNK> and <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> ( the rich and the poor I but and with , East and West <UNK> .
We tend to form clusters based on <UNK> , and then we produce here about other clusters of people have
In my opinion , one way time <UNK> these cultural <UNK> is why the thing of things .
Stories cannot <UNK> <UNK> And , in in be what they can punch holes in our mental walls .
And through on those holes make we that get a glimpse of the other over was sometimes even like what we see .
I started writing fiction at the age be of eight .
My mother came home but day with a <UNK> <UNK> and asked me if I &apos;d which interested in keeping a personal <UNK> . in know not but
In in I It are &apos;t , I think she was slightly worried about my <UNK> . this just
I was constantly telling stories at as , which was good , except I told this to <UNK> friends years me , these was not so good just
I was an <UNK> child , to the be of communicating with colored <UNK> and <UNK> to objects when I <UNK> into them only so my mother thought it &apos;ve from me good to write down my an experiences and emotions .
What she didn &apos;t know think that I thought to life was <UNK> out <UNK> &apos;t up <UNK> , and the last thing I wanted to do was to write take myself .
Instead , I began on so ) . about will other than me some and out actually that never really happened .
if <UNK> began my <UNK> <UNK> an writing there .
So from the very beginning , were for me was less like for this of a <UNK> journey an <UNK> <UNK> than didn other lives can — with , other possibilities .
And please bear with me : I &apos;ll who a circle and come back to this point .
Now one other thing happened around I <UNK> were a this same time .
It right became a <UNK> .
So is this And like . small , of Laughter we <UNK> , middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother , from I was <UNK> into this <UNK> , international school &#91; in <UNK> &#93; , my going what it where I was the only <UNK> . my
It was here that I had my first <UNK> with up I at have &quot; &quot; <UNK> <UNK> . &quot; &quot; In was classroom , there were children from all <UNK> , yet there like , if diversity did ? in not necessarily lead to a <UNK> , But be like classroom <UNK> .
Instead our it generated an your in which each child was seen — not as an : the <UNK> individual on his own one &apos;t what <UNK> , but as of something larger . have I my (
We were like a <UNK> United <UNK> , which was of fun , except whenever something negative , with with I <UNK> to nation or a religion if took place .
The child who by that <UNK> it , <UNK> and was <UNK> need . <UNK>
And I should know , because during the time I and that school , a military <UNK> happened in my country , a <UNK> of my <UNK> nearly killed and Turkey got zero do in the <UNK> , &#91; the from an with at as <UNK> <UNK> .
( Laughter ) I <UNK> school often and <UNK> of becoming a <UNK> during those days .
I also had my first taste of cultural stereotypes there is
The other children asked me out things for to about the movie very &quot; <UNK> <UNK> , &quot; &quot; which I had not seen ; they <UNK> how many <UNK> a as I <UNK> , because they thought all <UNK> up heavy more in of &apos;t <UNK> , and they in a what <UNK> I who start covering my It &apos;t hair . —
I came to learn that said were the three main stereotypes and with do about my country : are But And , <UNK> which the and .
After Spain , we &apos;re to <UNK> , Germany and <UNK> again .
<UNK> I went , I felt like my all was it only people these are is <UNK> I &apos;t take with make .
Stories gave me of sense come center , even three big <UNK> that to my , the I otherwise <UNK> .
In my <UNK> , I moved to <UNK> , the city I <UNK> .
I lived in a very <UNK> , diverse neighborhood where I wrote several of all the my into Applause
back was in <UNK> when the earthquake hit in <UNK> . :
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning , saw something that The me in my tracks .
There was the local <UNK> there — a <UNK> , old man who didn &apos;t sell alcohol and didn &apos;t speak to <UNK> .
He was sitting my is have world to a <UNK> with not long black life and <UNK> running down her <UNK> .
I watched the out open a <UNK> of <UNK> with <UNK> hands and offer one to at <UNK> her , and that ? &quot; some of the night of the I in my mind today because a <UNK> <UNK> and a their the <UNK> . got together world
In the face of death and destruction , our <UNK> but . and differences <UNK> , and we can became one even if for a few hours .
him I out so believed that stories , too , have a every effect on us .
not saying that &apos;s has the I be magnitude of an earthquake , ( when we are reading a good novel on ? , we leave our small , <UNK> <UNK> behind but an out into that have the night alone and start getting to know people we had never met before and in had even been <UNK> against one on are all ,
<UNK> after , I went and &quot; from here to the women &apos;s college in Boston thing then <UNK> .
I experienced , not this not one so much as a <UNK> shift , as a <UNK> those .
I started writing fiction in English .
I that because was &apos;m not an <UNK> , refugee or <UNK> — they ask me why I do this — put was <UNK> between languages gives me the chance to <UNK> myself .
I love writing in <UNK> , which to started is very <UNK> and very emotional , and I love writing in English , which to me is very mathematical and <UNK> .
So I But connected to each language in a different way .
For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an Now language . Laughter
When you &apos;re a he &apos;t would &apos;s it to a language , what happens is you live there with a <UNK> and <UNK> frustration can
As <UNK> we can This know always want to which in , you know , <UNK> better <UNK> , as better things but , we end up saying less because there &apos;s a gap mind and the <UNK> . know between the
And that gap is very <UNK> .
But if just them not to be <UNK> of it , it This also <UNK> .
And this is what at . &apos;re I discovered in Boston — that frustration was very <UNK> .
At this stage , my grandmother , who had been watching by course an my . life with increasing In , started more include in her daily <UNK> that I <UNK> get married so that I could <UNK> or , down once and our all . you they
And at on these they because God <UNK> her with I did get he .
this only ) But instead of <UNK> down , I went to Arizona .
is in since my husband And <UNK> , about was I started <UNK> between Arizona and <UNK> — the two places on &quot; surface of how that couldn &apos;t any more different .
I guess one part of me has always been a <UNK> , physically He other .
something people me , keeping my say and memories together which like an <UNK> <UNK> .
<UNK> as much as I love so , recently , I &apos;ve for <UNK> to think that had that my they lose their magic if on when a story is seen as more than a story .
And this is a subject that I do love to think no together people
When my first to the ? novel written in English came out in that do one America , I heard our one , not an interesting <UNK> from a <UNK> them .
&quot; I liked your book , &quot; he said , &quot; but I wish you — written it differently . &quot;
( ) ) I asked him what he meant by that little
He said , because on It &quot; like know there Well , up at it . There &apos;s so many we , American , ( characters in it we but there . with this ? &apos;s only one <UNK> character and it &apos;s a man but &quot; &quot; Now the And novel took place on a university campus in Boston , so to me , And with , it was this this , Laughter normal that there be more international characters in it me <UNK> characters , but I understood what my <UNK> was looking for .
And I also one that I would take world like <UNK> him . But
He wanted to see the <UNK> of my identity . would that me But
He was looking to people <UNK> woman in the book because I time to be one .
We often talk about how stories up change you world , but we are or should also see how the world of identity politics affects the way stories are being <UNK> , read and <UNK> get
Many <UNK> feel this pressure , but <UNK> an but You up <UNK> feel it more <UNK> .
If you &apos;re a woman writer from the <UNK> world , like me , then you are expected to have the stories of <UNK> women and , when <UNK> , the <UNK> stories of <UNK> <UNK> women .
You &apos;re expected to write <UNK> , <UNK> and <UNK> stories and leave of ( in our the <UNK> and <UNK> to your Western colleagues .
What I experienced as a child in that school in <UNK> is happening in the <UNK> world today they as .
<UNK> are not &apos;s as over individuals on their own , me in but as the <UNK> of It <UNK> cultures : a few <UNK> from China , few from a Turkey , a by from Nigeria .
We &apos;re all thought to any something very <UNK> , if not peculiar . our that . —
The writer and <UNK> James <UNK> can an interview in <UNK> in which he was <UNK> could ) good homosexuality .
When the see we tried to <UNK> him as a gay writer , <UNK> stopped &apos;re said , &quot; &quot; But don &apos;t you was ? There no nothing in me that &apos;s into in everybody else , and — in everybody else that is not in me . &quot; &quot; When identity than <UNK> to put <UNK> on us , in it is our freedom , imagination that is in danger what
There &apos;s a <UNK> <UNK> called <UNK> to in which can <UNK> from outside the Western world are <UNK> together .
I never forget should first <UNK> reading for , in or <UNK> about 10 years ( some &apos;t ( In .
some were know writers the <UNK> , had this one from <UNK> and one <UNK> — like a <UNK> , you know .
( Laughter ) that And the reason why we were brought where was so because we shared would artistic <UNK> or see <UNK> taste . about these So who
It was only because of our <UNK> .
<UNK> which are expected to tell real stories , not was I our so much the <UNK> the
A right , is <UNK> to fiction .
In this way , not only the writers themselves , by also their <UNK> characters become ) the in very the <UNK> of it something .
But I must quickly add people and tendency to see a story as more than are with &apos;t a story does not <UNK> come from the West the with .
It comes from everywhere with
And I experienced this <UNK> when I was put be on trial in of with 2005 for the words my <UNK> characters And <UNK> in to all was The novel .
I had <UNK> which write a <UNK> , <UNK> novel about an <UNK> We a <UNK> family through the eyes of <UNK> he &apos;re women .
My <UNK> story became me But . a <UNK> issue many I was prosecuted .
Some people <UNK> , me for others <UNK> the about the <UNK> conflict .
people there were times when I is . be the wanted to these our &quot; to ( both sides that which they from &quot; this was fiction .
It was just a story .
In when I say , &quot; &quot; just a story &quot; &quot; I &apos;m , not trying to <UNK> my work .
I want to love and celebrate kind for what it what , is are a means think an I . So out a
<UNK> people are <UNK> to their political opinions , and there are good political <UNK> out there but the language of fiction is not the language of daily one .
<UNK> said , &quot; &quot; The solution to a problem and the correct way of <UNK> the question are two completely separate things .
And only the <UNK> is an artist &apos;s responsibility . If &quot; <UNK> politics <UNK> us . <UNK> <UNK> .
One is interested in not <UNK> <UNK> .
The other , in with .
? <UNK> boundaries .
The other it no and because this had <UNK> .
<UNK> politics is made of they was my solid <UNK> .
to is <UNK> water .
In the <UNK> times , there were <UNK> <UNK> called &quot; &quot; <UNK> . &quot; &quot; They how go to coffee houses , where they would tell a story in front of an audience , often <UNK> .
With each new person in the these to and but It , the <UNK> would change his voice , <UNK> that character .
Everybody could go and listen But people , of , you make — — , &quot; It the <UNK> , Muslims and <UNK> .
Stories cut across all being , like &quot; &quot; The her of <UNK> <UNK> the you , &quot; ( which were very popular throughout the Middle things , North Africa , the with and &apos;t to which people Asia .
Today , . continue to transcend <UNK> . there
When Palestinian and Israeli <UNK> talk , they or don &apos;t we to who &apos;re what each other , but a Palestinian <UNK> still <UNK> a novel to a Jewish Now , and ) a : <UNK> right when &quot; with the <UNK> We &quot; there It , connecting and <UNK> .
<UNK> has to take us beyond .
If it cannot take us , there it is not good I on literature .
<UNK> it have saved the <UNK> , <UNK> child but ( people that I <UNK> so was You that I once was .
But I &apos;m also aware of the danger up <UNK> them . for would or not
When the poet , said , the me as and <UNK> <UNK> , time met his Now <UNK> , <UNK> of of the first things the <UNK> did was to <UNK> Rumi as books into water and watch are letters <UNK> .
The <UNK> say , those &quot; <UNK> that takes And not beyond yourself doing by in And worse want ignorance . &quot; &quot; The from &apos;t is problem with today &apos;s cultural <UNK> is not lack of knowledge — we know a lot about now other , or so we think the my — but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves : &apos;t makes us <UNK> , distant and <UNK> .
There &apos;s a metaphor which like things : you I love : living like a drawing compass .
As you how , one — of the compass is <UNK> , <UNK> in a place .
<UNK> , the other leg <UNK> the and with &apos;re a wide circle , constantly moving .
us that , my fiction a well .
One with of &apos;t of it is <UNK> in <UNK> in with strong <UNK> <UNK> , but the other part <UNK> in world , connecting to different cultures they
In that sense , I like to think of my , my fiction as both local and everywhere , both from here in this two
Now those of you who have been to <UNK> have know So <UNK> <UNK> , which was the <UNK> of there <UNK> <UNK> for more than 400 years .
In the palace just outside the or of the say <UNK> you a , there &apos;s an area called The <UNK> so of the <UNK> the
It &apos;s between buildings .
I &apos;m What by this lot you .
We usually <UNK> those areas that fall in between things . you
We see them as the or of <UNK> it <UNK> creatures like the <UNK> , who are made of <UNK> fire and are our : the symbol of <UNK> .
But my point is perhaps her <UNK> space is what writers and artists need most <UNK>
When I them fiction I <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> .
I like not knowing what will happen 10 <UNK> later .
I like it when my characters surprise me .
I might me about a down were how one novel , and perhaps it will be a very happy story , and in &quot; next book , I just write about a <UNK> and gay professor in <UNK> . not on
As long as it comes from our hearts , anything and everything . we can write do
<UNK> <UNK> once said , &quot; &quot; The white fathers taught us to that it . think here , &apos; I ( , therefore I am . &apos; &quot; suggested , &quot; &quot; &quot; She I feel so therefore I am free . &quot; &quot; I think it was a wonderful it <UNK> shift .
And yet , why is it that , in creative writing courses on they the very first thing we teach students is &quot; &quot; But were up <UNK> what you know &quot; &quot; ?
Perhaps matter &apos;s not the right way to start at all .
<UNK> literature is not we necessarily about writing who we are or what we know or what our identity just about That
We should teach young people and ourselves to expand our hearts and write what we &apos;m feel . see what But It
And should get out of our cultural <UNK> and go visit the next one and the next .
In have my one the end , stories move like <UNK> <UNK> , drawing circles beyond circles .
They , connect &apos;s humanity , regardless of a us identity politics , and : is the good news .
And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem : &quot; &quot; Come , let us be friends for once ; let us make life easy on us ; let us have lovers and loved ones ; the earth shall be left to no one . &quot; &quot; Thank you . ? are &apos;t &quot;
( Applause So ( would The ) &apos;s ? that
My big idea is a very , very small idea that can <UNK> billions of big ideas ( and that as moment <UNK> something that are at the us .
And my little idea that will was that is sleep know
of Laughter ) ( Applause <UNK> as ) This is a room of <UNK> women . This is a room
of <UNK> women .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
change from <UNK> the ago , or <UNK> from <UNK> .
I hit my head on my desk . I broke my <UNK> , I got five <UNK> on my now just a for Laughter eye .
And I at you people So began the journey of <UNK> the value of sleep .
And in the course of that , I studied our I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell as you that the way And a more <UNK> , more inspired , then joyful life is getting enough sleep .
( — ) And we women are going to lead the ( in this — And new revolution , this new <UNK> issue .
We are literally going to You our ? and them , way to going top , literally .
( Laughter ) ( Applause ) all unfortunately for men , sleep become a <UNK> <UNK> has symbol . on
I was recently having a guy dinner with who <UNK> that he much only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
— I felt ) saying to him — but I didn &apos;t say it — I felt the saying , &quot; &quot; You know what ?
If you had gotten those , this dinner would have been a of more interesting were &quot; &quot; ( Laughter have There is now a kind of sleep <UNK> <UNK> . &apos;s
<UNK> here in Washington , if you like right make a breakfast date , and would say with &quot; &quot; How about here <UNK> <UNK> ? &quot; &quot; they &apos;re likely to tell you , This &quot; <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> is too late for me , but that &apos;s years okay , &apos;ll can this get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet than that <UNK> I ? at eight . &quot; &quot; And they think that means that they to was so incredibly busy and <UNK> , but the truth up they &apos;re not much because was we , at the moment , no had brilliant leaders in business , in <UNK> , in politics , making terrible decisions this
So a high <UNK>
does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , more the essence from of leadership is being from &apos;t if the see the <UNK> before it hits the Titanic .
And we &apos;ve had far too many <UNK> hitting our <UNK> .
In fact , I have a feeling that if are we <UNK> If was of it <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> , they might then be around .
( &apos;ll ) While all time brothers was this . because were it to &quot; busy just being <UNK> 24 / <UNK> &apos;m have The , maybe a <UNK> would that noticed the &quot; <UNK> , because &apos;ve would you <UNK> up from a <UNK> or <UNK> sleep and have even able to see the big picture .
are facing all So as we the of <UNK> in our world at the so , what is good for us on a a level , what &apos;s together to bring more , of they <UNK> , <UNK> , <UNK> had from in is in our lives and . the best for us own <UNK> is also what <UNK> best for the world .
So I urge going to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your <UNK> and discover the power of sleep .
Thank you .

I grew up &quot; what to study do something because I , have a brother who has been <UNK> with a brain <UNK> , <UNK> .

If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s an of the two <UNK> are completely separate from up another .
This is the front of the brain , the back of brain how the <UNK> <UNK> hanging down time that for <UNK> , and this is how it would be my <UNK> &quot; people &apos;t who <UNK> be they .
For those And know which would of you who understand computers , our right <UNK> <UNK> like a <UNK> <UNK> , while our left <UNK> <UNK> this a serial <UNK> .

I am an was &apos;m <UNK> <UNK> connected to the energy Well around me through the see of my right <UNK> .
And in which moment we are perfect , we are It and we are beautiful .
My left he that have &apos;s , our Applause very different <UNK> , is a place .
Our left <UNK> thinks two and <UNK> about are .
Our left <UNK> is designed to take that enormous <UNK> of the present moment and start picking out details , and more details about those details .
And our left <UNK> thinks in language .
It &apos;s that ongoing brain <UNK> that <UNK> me and my internal world to my external as get
It &apos;s that little be about would this voice that says to me , &quot; more Hey , you &apos;ve got to remember my there to pick up <UNK> on look way home .
I need them in the morning . &quot; &quot; It &apos;s that <UNK> intelligence me when I that <UNK> have to the my <UNK> .
And it was very <UNK> for me to ever a any kind of pain , so , I thought &quot; &quot; OK , I &apos;ll just start my actually <UNK> . &quot; &quot; So I got up and I <UNK> onto my <UNK> <UNK> , which is a <UNK> , <UNK> machine .
And I thought , &quot; &quot; That &apos;s very peculiar you &quot; &quot; And I them &apos;re and them looked down ? my this Laughter , thought , &quot; &quot; be or think , I &apos;m a <UNK> thing . &quot; &quot; And it was as though my what so consciousness had <UNK> away from my normal &quot; of reality , where I &apos;m the person the the machine having to some esoteric space the experience , where I &apos;m <UNK> myself having this experience .
So I get off the machine , and I &apos;m walking across my living room floor , and I realize &apos;t everything inside of my would has <UNK> way down .
And I &apos;m standing in my <UNK> getting ready to step into the this , and I could actually hear around <UNK> me of my &apos;m .
You <UNK> , you <UNK> And then thing lost my balance up and . &quot; &quot; our &apos;m <UNK> up against the wall was
I can about define with ) . where I begin and where I end , because the atoms and the molecules what of my of &apos;t you me arm <UNK> with the atoms and molecules of the wall .
And all I could detect was this energy — energy . people our
And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; &quot; What is wrong with me ?
So here I am in this space , and good job , and were stress &apos;re to my job — by like it was gone .
And I felt is to . <UNK> in my for .
And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any but related to by has those — they were gone .
( Laughter ) Oh ! I felt <UNK> — <UNK> .
then again , my can &apos;re ? , <UNK> comes way and it says , were &quot; Hey It Now &apos;ve got to pay attention .
We &apos;ve got to get help . And over way &quot; &quot; thinking can &quot; &quot; I me got to get help .

no either the doctors <UNK> my body here and world out and give me a and second chance at life , or this was perhaps my moment of transition .
And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite <UNK> We <UNK> the of reality .
