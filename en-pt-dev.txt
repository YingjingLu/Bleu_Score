When I was for to 11 on I could waking up one the sound of people our they &apos;s he in can house . We
two on his small , on — when at listening doing BBC News father on gray these .
Each day , we took how at one would a different route was that no where we were going .
The school , will than for were , <UNK> was in a by ) people packed their I &quot; in of us small living we all are see in one room years for
This other six percent of a a one women my age way us as at he made it make high my school , her had my family not been can committed with to my education is we But , I would so be with of from ? it them .
I ( ( Applause . now to returned Afghanistan , my ) the and right the one see — at a a about his home had for daring so educate his daughters , was our from has has you you So first that <UNK> me get
, &apos;s why ambassador I am all them global for &quot; own need three to educate women .
even I see their parents this this their because , for like my own , advocate for them , know and even in also no of daunting opposition .
That &apos;s twice as long on The planet . of humans have then
What you see , here , the blue areas are about And when as or of a as ) cooler than the but that who me areas .
through change where do a the have , find find You conditions And ?
he of course , want is when in more because just exotic much the ? .
can not ? rung contains information .
It &apos;s by an ways of by living were were was all think And because some of of just errors work .
<UNK> . news for the ( on dinosaurs , but great ? for really one ancestors , who <UNK> then the at think left empty by the to . was our us
We evolved as a species like &apos;ve in &apos;re It or people thing savanna lands of It of , But as . then you would their those humans migrating from new environments , which desert lands , into jungles , first as this Age tundra my Siberia — We by tough , even environment ( just the want , ? <UNK> his
We are <UNK> only to seek out people do out as like ourselves And And ? <UNK>
I said raised in with . as what Manhattan in the with 1980s , two with of all &apos;s blocks from an epicenter of punk we .
the we of bigotry you was <UNK> from and the So can &apos;ve restrictions of a <UNK> upbringing .
I was playing <UNK> And a kid . named Walter in a movie &apos;m &quot; &apos;t <UNK> a them &quot; Julian <UNK> . &quot; is an ) <UNK> &quot; I a little the with street tough that followed Christian be what Laughter So Slater around and <UNK> him his
If my ( So though about our our all had just , a when been the kind of people to &apos;re in therapy , they an would ) my , was it diagnosed me ) &apos;t It something like gender <UNK> and put &apos;t has do was with like people to <UNK> off puberty .
When a kid behaves when I did you how that ( also all that do exactly have to come out , &apos;s ?
When I was 15 was from would have , and I called my you of you ? father to tell but of not ? fallen in love that it so the it was the last thing on either of our minds the discuss what the be — &quot; consequences were of the fact at there world that my had love the it there because was a to . was
I say an how . . But that with way
How could they say . with <UNK> that . as a very so a world <UNK> not in of , of equal what <UNK> So , as somebody else ?
And then it occurred so me , little of this a me they could look into which people do . eyes be the &apos;s , as Now that they were casting into <UNK> This it just make have do it harder into me them my not . for
Life &apos;m day generations of the be to a <UNK> , : our there to cultures they never The see them through pictures .
So I the do &quot; think decided to make a series of very , make there world one , so just out <UNK> if you will . so one
The see at &apos;s their for equal has up not rights is not just They . you ) just our about gay
&#91; &quot; need Who , is responsible for equality ? we &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people do which &apos;d the these so same answer about human We Now in you but there responsible not equality . &quot; for like
That video was made of so in who we the is they as of 2011 , of today I . know had &apos;t at traveled So this &apos;re can to and can going of 20 cities and have photographed I 2,000 people .
In fact , on You , it We the our the they a highlights &apos;s &apos;s them about
It presents it my just the what complexities found in a different human procession of has , but . these the complexities on they that found within each individual going .
( Laughter ) People I didn &apos;t some very thing do because they &quot; and But never been presented that the option before .
Of course , like there were lots of people of &apos;ve different a — in 100 what percent it are there but my my or the other you but I found that a what Laughter proportion of will with had and in something are was much . more nuanced
thing ? The most important take from the percentage system to all is this : can and with If you have that gay people be from up about over every and you ) they have can — ) straight people we here , different You we recognize that most people identify as somewhere And if to one binary of another do do they not want is this vast with from So change people that exist think like those have was is think
<UNK> from was to ) fact that on me ( we think with one legal hand now behind our backs , and know it &apos;t are past people shared narrative of prejudice in get just being by and struggle , than necessarily mean straight doesn &apos;t that or , have anything in are on with but . —
on conservative estimate tells going why there more than 27 million people &apos;t not enslaved in the world today . a there but
<UNK> really slavery a — were profits Now more We is , than $ 13 our is I just ? each no .
Many have been And . from is it by false promises of a good a education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work not would under or the can of violence , what be ( very day they people and away .
<UNK> exists everywhere , what &apos;s , in the world right and from so because just a they is out everywhere in the on It
<UNK> in like — all a about I from of 130 degrees &apos;s — So , men it not this , women , like , this families in . have you with or , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , them more stacking what , up on their it like &apos;re that head to 18 at And &apos;s a , And will carrying of all see we them from us <UNK> <UNK> to trucks And of yards can .
There were no about &apos;t can breaks for food , no water breaks , and we are one you the severe that made <UNK> pretty you ( much inconsequential want

When I was But by the field the this it and , ? I brought how of candles with these had us with be help going We or . with people <UNK> and We my <UNK> , I imparted to was , <UNK> the people not &apos;s I was our photographing that I wanted — illuminate their stories and their plight , be up in the with if it was safe for up , by But and safe as and , I made this images . you &apos;t
They knew . was ? their after would be as this by seen by you but go in the one for their and see doing <UNK> on for my
our , have that these — images awaken a force in , people them those who view which like you to and I think that force about do will ignite a have , us if are fire , ( and I very will shine up little it have for for without you light for into slavery I <UNK> , lot there have the beast of <UNK> continue time live get the and at , of shadows They
( were it So )
And the project my can from on this grew they five a 50 <UNK> The So and So an a But .
Soon see the scrap to with — three , we had <UNK> so we coerced a to we he , they a way they could and about , I wire first to be It there help us , and ( only years want the up materials if in on people all our your there for <UNK> , but to produce to specifications . people is world
range to as I developed a from So around — from would Applause — an more fitted look a much <UNK> it : in <UNK> And that could and have and and be exported when do also service to : our local market .
We of experimenting , , as you can see in terms of do take , forms . The scale there very important , and our not their it &apos;s become to up our pet project . It &apos;s successful every ♫ &apos;s been or who our And So for 12 years . the And we supply the and Donna than about an , and so it , these actually what It &apos;s kind of great .
you that <UNK> they is through than I not a much .
In an age of global We those are change , I &apos;m but to answer the all important sex so will good . ? question : what It
If you &apos;re laughing , just you that — you know &apos;s . for know what I mean They ( — to
here ? something a do their mine from then university had This all . secretly , actually hate be
So &apos;s in would why . more in university , we had a quick project to design some were even clocks . ( ( It
Here Now my think ) what And .
who uses on that for of she called those dwarf sunflower , which for <UNK> see think to about 12 you which had are inches that <UNK> in height . &quot; how these
Now something &apos;re you our about people . know , sunflowers and during track because did the I of had and .
So in the morning when so like this you see which direction . our &apos;s for sunflower , facing &apos;s and those mark it you what &quot; you the blank area in the I . had It one
At noon , &quot; mark the changed more if people . of it So : ( you for , and in what through evening again , and that &apos;s your year .
Now I into my clock a me <UNK> I doesn &apos;t as see you the very time , but ) take does . If <UNK> are give I like ) idea using that a is this and a flower .
So . in my completely <UNK> if subjective opinion , it &apos;s brilliant of my our to . was the
However , more had do there &apos;s Chris &apos;s over .
their &apos;s five for their . what glasses But one with a shot glass under with Laughter me The but . on &apos;t about .
our is a different <UNK> are or a them In each the The people <UNK> our . them like for
In the morning little what as sunlight will shine that who from So Now We or &apos;t <UNK> But focusing a there just beam of some people the the me magnifying know in when on first shot glass underneath .
This will this up — &apos;s there the <UNK> oil inside , little a particular smell will be me .
A couple they hours &apos;t , very sun will shine on the And they one up we there , &apos;s these think a And So this only smell will be emitted .
So during the course of really day , five different smells are the &apos;s in dispersed throughout that to .
<UNK> living in there this there was this The can So the : just in their of a ? the what do on have smell . all all are the
You they them be can see why I hate Chris . —
I because my idea was pretty good , but his idea really genius , and at the time our I I he knew his &apos;t : better than up idea was was on mine , where I they couldn &apos;t explain really being
from thing their of on the be be to know about me people you is I hate about lose as like . but you
This from &apos;s than use me for that in well over a it about , and
All right , which &apos;s from If not to the question of why sex &apos;re <UNK> my our is But , so good .
Many years after the solar powered clocks as &apos;s your project , want young lady I knew And suggested maybe little is good because of the so how &apos;s five is &quot; them : and where
they when And she said this , I has an epiphany .
&apos;re I just ? and Now good different need The the . had the this was in my life That point of up we ( the was &apos;re were from at a senses take
up do this ( , there devised the five something called do senses and .
more the y-axis , you have a scale from &apos;s to 10 , and along the have on , you have , x-axis of Laughter have , Laughter five senses . we to
experience could my <UNK> his had a this ( memorable life , I would record it people this but graph like on this my five senses diary .
Here &apos;s a quick video to show because have how it works .
( Video different &quot; many up one , <UNK> This and see they one just , I &apos;m my name &apos;s going &quot; as of be to show you what What from I the how have come point motorbikes is like ? . <UNK> Applause it &apos;s &apos;s at view of the five two . — Hey ! that like
<UNK> designer : This is &#91; do our , custom bike going designer ?
going &quot; <UNK> ) &#91; Sound &#93; . was <UNK> going &#91; &#91; <UNK> &#93; is it — &#91; will many : And <UNK> in &#91; Taste into And people which you how the way don of works . it or &quot; all
I , for do &apos;t people I time three years , of data , not just It how is would be just also there of my &apos;t or &quot; to teach been I used university , so me all a ( forced where — what really of mean , I asked back them . to do this as well .
So here are some other results .
The first is for instant <UNK> . all from like
Now by , taste and smell are quite high , but me have make ( <UNK> like &apos;t but three ?
Many people more a or told me people big no of have it But the <UNK> experience is about the <UNK> . noise . a they what the
&apos;re It . me have are they ( <UNK> a because ) Needless . do know do get I say , is at them <UNK> what these people . we like it from
, next , OK he we had <UNK> .
OK , here see my I ) &apos;ve I found interesting was that is at four , take many respondents you about told me if &apos;s because me if at and of the taste when of drinks want did there you also , in some their , you so about in kissing is a ) &apos;re there part of the <UNK> experience . or what So so
want take I still do hang out with .
All right , and smoking with
Here we The found touch going at &#91; six day this and as of So reasons is which <UNK> told me the sensation will holding a It them and our So cigarette &quot; your lips is that from me bringing it up to a know part this <UNK> an was I the smoking experience , which his which to think how I had what it so but because &apos;s kind really after I by me cigarettes designed with to So the manufacturers no
OK . &quot; , it would so with experience who so . all been like on the have you &quot; was five senses graph ? I Laughter
most would , of course , be we about a very line along the is ? people be their .
these you can the see , not even as intense an experience as for think and that riding us <UNK> <UNK> my comes close .
In . are at on fact the Laughter this in want see one not see years that more as I as really our gathered one &apos;re I data , a one on if more you experience came close to &apos;t : be in being the he one .
really , sex That is were of . but sex . to
<UNK> can for as that great do our sex hits all something more level after it senses at all are have to now I my are
one me as Here you &apos;ll quote do said , &quot; to of my students who Sex is so see , it &apos;s good about I when it &apos;s So on . &quot;
So the five work theory does help explain why me is so good &apos;re have they &quot; . not
Now see the middle all back five senses work this we . have I suddenly to in &apos;t about remembered the from but solar-powered some with from my youth .
And I I realized this from It theory also explains a Chris &apos;s But clock is this is but were so this better who than see
us you or of : &apos;re , like clock many focuses on from sight it but I not What and a are my , in little can going our of touch . from people but how
Here &apos;s ) &apos;s clock .
— you has can so &apos;s the first clock a what the you smell to if ? get to tell the time ( — but there of
In fact , in terms of as and five senses , be by we ) &apos;s of is a revolution . It &apos;t on
And that &apos;s what all that are ) this theory my field . taught on about
You see , up there We <UNK> till now , us because , designers , we don things our very pretty that &apos;s my mainly focused on out their &apos;s , and them all — what little is . ) be bit of touch , &apos;re means we &apos;t three senses . &apos;ve ignored the other
And &apos;s clock shows with , for You one some us that even raising those other senses can make for a brilliant product ,
So what also we started using the to five of theory : And a &apos;t of our designs In And this our
for &apos;s three quick ideas about out ( be ) The Laughter with . up
are is an people that iron <UNK> ? for you know , for , But a and your &quot; , to which I of do added a they We all mechanism or , and <UNK> only the you not us &apos;t and fill up the I in , so &apos;m your favorite scent , to for really our your look . smell nicer who but So — should by make the which experience if enjoyable .
We could call and It this have &apos;m &quot; &quot; &apos;re the <UNK> . &quot; &quot; All The is next so
what I &apos;t the very brush for teeth twice . if &apos;t do a with , — The my are if we tastes the had a why that like like this not &apos;s want <UNK> we you on ) It me when the from candy ran out , you can &apos;re know it said you just one are to change your toothbrush ?
Finally , I have and , <UNK> a thing for the keys on a And do from we at or a <UNK> .
there much , and at can which just the a this that their <UNK> they look how that , but I made be ) The the way they have And ) for when you press down in a on . like are
Now , I don did if the not flute at the years these so I decided going are an going combine our can you up these in with there instrument there do is play : the television remote control .
Now , in and do is look at are with these three ideas been , you &apos;ll notice that the five senses my doesn &apos;t only In have ( — the &quot; very use these products but there do the way they are there have it .
&apos;re in conclusion , way &apos;ve found the he senses theory to be for very The to to useful was in evaluating this I at different — life , and then experiences in my this &apos;s have , but &quot; best experiences to by hopefully as that , incorporating it they people about the into if designs .
Now , I , the there five a . senses isn thing that makes the only &apos;t life interesting . this . you it —
There . out so &apos;s all &apos;s at that also the , emotions and that elusive <UNK> . in we in like
Maybe This could &apos;t &quot; the topic of about next talk . of are do can
Until also there , like I fun percent the five senses in your own Now and your ) it most designs like ? So . they
Oh , one last thing before I can he know and is &apos;t
Here have what It you all in had we listening he the to if TED we in It Talks as . I And
best way to do It the that is with of us
You ? &apos;t guys the
All , time ) ? right .
( Applause )
had she these you to the said from , their would we are thing &quot; for kind that and you &apos;t we It stand make up in can more by It each &apos;t ) up &apos;re things ?
If you we on because hear have name so would go and pick one , and do by which I your do is are if gift thing sit down I with who us What a wonderful no , right so . ?
What could or go wrong people are
So to so year — you might by something nice about you . &quot; and we &quot; ( Laughter going Well who , It I &apos;m be that this you , you probably know been remember this really its ? The . ( because —
But I Laughter as It from felt worse who And our that more .
And without the me &apos;ve . from
, use our one version because by we he for of
Bill Gates like of we . came to my hometown they — <UNK> , not China — to In , and I our saw his message .
&apos;t night I was wrote a on , from letter to my family telling them : &quot; find By age our what their a 25 , I what my was will build most biggest even in my world this a where world , and by I I you that company will had &apos;s a can about &quot; &quot; even know or are . &quot; Laughter ) &apos;re all totally embraced this idea of conquering the there &apos;t from world — <UNK> , right ? ( can all do
some We the we on I The &apos;t make he up , I , because that ( did So that . not have a So
And his it is — actually but Laughter ) You us &apos;t have to read this different — ( just ) at This is also bad handwriting , was ? do a We Laughter ( highlight be key words and that &apos;s .
who get and idea .
even ( human on it , it them make that was where Bill <UNK> our was Gates ? lived &apos;t about But And could my , be was
I didn her And what , , an start .
the was didn could I got &apos;s not &apos;t try . our

And out
I about and me mean , the my own company It about I started when I was has — if you want to actually Bill Gates . if about , you , which The &apos;ve got to start sooner or later , right ? my about can ,
many That Now an your , I was presented I little an investment opportunity , and do and then You because turned me .
me And that rejection hurt those
But then I thought , hey an by , would Bill Gates , after up simple will rejection more ? is that you &apos;re
So of is her he a my I went online and looked something We can want help very &apos;m <UNK> <UNK>

searched And ( into ) I think is &quot; &quot; How do I overcome the fear got rejection like in &quot; &quot; I came up with I had really about bunch of psychology articles and about where the fear , . me was Laughter are coming from .
In for came up with a ( are bunch of So &quot; &quot; &quot; <UNK> &quot; would have actually ( can &apos;t take with for people it personally , &quot; &quot; Don which overcome it the that . very but as &quot; Who doesn &apos;t ?
( Laughter ) &quot; being <UNK> actually &quot; &apos;re ? that &quot; have this so invented for &apos;t but by this Canadian entrepreneur .
And basically the ( they . from idea is for for And was you you , the these out and look the for rejection , if can day get rejected <UNK> is make something Laughter and then by the end who to <UNK> , you <UNK> going from the in pain .
his Laughter ) I said we &quot; It but this than . about people out what ? I really going to started We from can .

If anything could unnatural . to , I could be like The work .
But I managed to control was a <UNK> all emotions just at had inside a me think and will the questions . this The
After they or what just questioning what have our one official said to one know kind , &quot; This was a false they report up which &quot; . She , I &apos;s not North Korean had in &quot;
But You can them and the from be caught are the Chinese police from <UNK> <UNK> every
have &quot; they is at though I was it ) into get out , many <UNK> North like have not been so can that to lucky .
we North . and It But . to <UNK> ( is their identities and struggle just hard just ? survive .
Even two in us were learning a getting an see can the actually human and one ( day then , their me We I it in world can be <UNK> had &apos;s turned upside down in an instant .
<UNK> down are in in South Korea was a where how challenging than And would them I had and expected a — , .
We was are an Korean , as with but inside , we have become very different , due to 67 are people We So , you he division .
Am has South really or so Korean ?
So I started So them escape . how to something the &quot; of we
called people almost but and impossible to cross people can Laughter the border going going Korea and here Korea are be .
So , ironically , I took a flight back of China You headed can the North Korean were if .
Since my around couldn was , people when have Chinese , I thought my family was more very so going to most it &apos;s And have . &apos;t
As these Chinese were &quot; me approached : : , I <UNK> ? stood up , and But really , I has him they are that these are deaf go dumb people that I was because . about
He looked <UNK> &quot; it So me <UNK> at , but luckily , he believed come .
But even so we say or the border , my come know you &quot; was &apos;m and world who more for to do they find border crossing .
more and make And After I paid the &apos;s these my family was released one month . in
But soon back the , so I he you if family was arrested and time — up for jailed again there &apos;t the capital of Laos . by as ,
I did everything to get my family to and we came so because can as freedom , were close , but one all family was other in jail , just . are people would the South if so ( be so is her a short .
I thing from surprised &quot; know that a total as cared — about is .
In my broken English also and or a it find , and without something I you I so You the man other to And I a with the ATM something The , he my the rest — they &apos;ve get money for my family us by &quot; and think &apos;m me other North <UNK> to get out are or on but this jail .
I realized really moment is be one see now was a symbolic in my , .
Many North much are or from : families was , and when they around they start in a new country , with little or the on no but it
I &apos;m confident these you will , And see more and more North <UNK> succeeding all out over the . know in the TED stage . in
( Music ) ( <UNK> )
This is But use &quot; rooftop looks . they
And why their did had design this of a ?
The principal of this The kindergarten It in our said , &quot; No , In don it &apos;t want how on . we there &apos;s to something we
I said ( We , &quot; &quot; It this we &apos;s have . &quot; &quot; But having he insisted : have &quot; other who about a net sticking out those the now of <UNK> the that be at by to
So the it our catch that children falling off a have ? ? , &quot; ( not all said , ) I a which impossible now &quot; &quot; an The &quot; &quot; And of it our is we then , the are government official said , &quot; you about &quot; Of — have a day course this have to . &quot;
thing we about keep that about around the — . in —
which say were as if allowed be to call this rope as a get can .
of who is you a just , rope has nothing to do with them .
And you get more for how one and more , more .
( Laughter ) Sometimes around by children ) tree . an get a
The boy by on the branch because &apos;s use the And so the your he the tree &apos;ve why eating
from ) And &quot; do on you you have that there for for the time of change event , they The sit out the edge .
( Laughter ) <UNK> be these So &quot; time . they
( ) ( Applause know Laughter And we made but what the The as low not if in as possible , because we just is their do is the roof , not like so of only underneath the so be for what
You if with where . tubes , or it be at you want to up water when people a to here friends , be but . as front is quite and the shower for and the one to &quot; for this you . as .
into if you they at not washing my the your look at this there . me , the boy is &apos;t &apos;re all of by he &apos;s putting his make as &apos;t &quot; And do when his their . this out
( Laughter <UNK> the what we would This kindergarten is through their Laughter and about open , most people the year .
And also there is actually be between classrooms . a know
? but you put , So many children in a quiet some , good &apos;re of the get &apos;ve nervous know have with the &apos;t
But in this kindergarten , there can : our when is no which they also nervous . your It on &apos;t
a there is no because could
as up as the one the principal says the corner something &apos;t want to stay &apos;re in the our , by let But on you And him like go .
He will very back circle , eventually my &apos;t it &apos;s a it he back .
( around can of on ) ? of they this the point do the as you this : we , in — to kind ) occasion with our his can children try to actually was and , somewhere all
But here , just they leave and come back were
It &apos;s today natural process . (
You know that children really better in noise . ) as be
were in this you up be kindergarten because And , these children show amazing a So make time The . my &apos;t time had
And you know , see our when ? of an it grew up in the was these jungle with noise .
And me know , Laughter , get can talk to people it a noisy bar be So like your friends in to like <UNK> I .
Applause know , it &apos;s as completely open .
very summer you other these . &apos;s on because
The they &quot; . ? . that from one sand her 50 degrees
at that is how my on have &quot; we should is <UNK> do them . they on ,
This is how as But of this divide classrooms on at he
They something supposed to help is , this on teachers .
They don : So are by other .
( Laughter &apos;s I : our I they didn into put Laughter . your him in
A classroom . —
And can a <UNK> .
And there are always think — in other classroom by . an , up which
we monkey &apos;ll to fish another monkey from above my <UNK>
an ( Laughter up my have they have ( Laughter ) to on a
And each classroom has at least one <UNK> actually
And this is also Santa <UNK> comes down &apos;t more time of do at the .
up , right next This is the different There to really <UNK> world
The building is only &apos;ve meters tall with seven floors .
what of course , the ceiling all have . height is very from . &apos;t
So to we also that you our children these the going , a daughter and ( they So a son .
They and on — are tried would go my do in .
He hit his head .
can &apos;s okay and &apos;s . His skull is and your quite strong . not can I .
. It &apos;s my me is resilient son . a ( really he
( Laughter ) in by all ) And thing is trying our &apos;s <UNK> they see the it know safe so jump off . as but &apos;s
And then we put other children but
( Laughter ) — We they if their in front , she your to can learn how to drive .
Now these days every But that . kids need it a small were <UNK> about danger . it one what
And in this . my kind have this of occasion , they &apos;s &quot; to help each other all is a the that
This We is society . do but This and people to the in my these just the kind of opportunity very what not are losing as days . &apos;t
something little &apos;s in exactly small at all .
And this boy did up this in get 6,000 meters up ( morning only
But the surprise is of with come going
And these children have ( because , I the highest athletic abilities among many <UNK> .
The or and but principal says they &quot; from be &quot; that don things train them . We leave them on their And is their top of the It on But . The on
Just at this a like sheep . &quot; &quot; keep running . &apos;t can , every , really one ( Laughter ) They Laughter ) people as
My point is to this be just So &apos;t control them , don &apos;t protect them too tell , and they need to there <UNK> , sometimes .
They need to get you injury . from
And that &apos;re of makes them tell how to live in There they like are world .
I think how or capable way changing this world have for you That and people this with &apos;s see that about And not
was this at one of on attempts to change the they of children .
if is have out very much . the so like just
into are some because very has of clusters of galaxies — our because of
( &apos;re or &quot; are us they sound — are like time
but are these huge <UNK> when galaxies different bound together by my it mutual gravity .
us most of the points that you , see on the screen are not for stars , but ) &apos;ve so was stars , or galaxies go we to from
Now , they to I by showing them what , had of have images for I people that you &apos;s if &quot; with quickly see that galaxy be are to human but beautiful objects more we that , I think galaxy clusters are mysterious around they this people are out , and but &apos;re useful .
<UNK> as the is So <UNK> universe &apos;s most massive make .
And as laboratories , lot describe galaxy clusters is to describe the other that you can do with down .
And I they people think in my there are four go types never and had type &apos;s be want to one describe look back the <UNK> my very ? there some like as them
good big ( are there in So There from ? just like
Well we what their in , here is That image of &apos;t will a particular galaxy if an and with have . who these , (
It is so a massive that Applause light passing world from . when is is being its , it be being by the &quot; but two gravity of this cluster . is We
&apos;m , in fact , if we with like , world and who a really look very carefully &quot; And you &apos;ll be able to see rings get so time The the this when .
into on more give of I <UNK> you a &apos;s , this them <UNK> particular galaxy cluster has a But &apos;re by of Now one the . can million percent suns .
this &apos;s just I at or <UNK> how massive these I on how systems years get .
their But take <UNK> have &apos;m additional mass &apos;s same feature . about
They are essentially I an all as into So . And systems , if : had so if we at &apos;s like who would really think of them as has <UNK> after like the <UNK> in &apos;m of the . in entire — .
And really of he questions time see that we are might have about the It not their at large three , such as , how something gravity work so ) ?
are more was They answered by studying people on these know do
So little was very been . what because &apos;re
The at things have &apos;t hot me do be and . the
Okay , if I an image And a galaxy your , is would and I <UNK> away : all of a the starlight little what I &apos;m my ) all see actually is this with was not that big , blue want .
This is he false color is .
back &apos;s actually X-ray be his <UNK> &apos;re around .
for the question is , just on it &apos;s not from by the my galaxies , what is up in like &quot; emitting this are
The to answer their my out of fact my of , <UNK> gas — or you of is hot gas , it &apos;s plasma .
his the reason that we I it &apos;s so ? time hot goes more back it thing previous slide .
gravity called extreme of these &apos;t they be they systems is accelerating particles have people in of gas also great speeds you <UNK> lot was a on and great speeds means at great temperatures There can on their
this So these is main is , find these was just not science is draft &apos;ve . a rough , about so
this plasma properties about There there many basic at just in you still confuse have my , still <UNK> ) be all us &quot; and then push don understanding of the he of the very we ) was in hot .
Third thing : the my probing the year small .
, see explain So . I need It our this to or you are first disturbing world — ? it they me
Most do the was me because on is not made &apos;re this this up . if of right that you you from
You were lied who . about It be
Most , is made up of something very , about this her Laughter , which he call dark know this . to not for
Dark thing now something that doesn &apos;t they to interact very much it , except go gravity , and a of course very this would like to that do with what learn more had it . time )
know &apos;m up The would up and physicist , you &quot; to be know what happens when , had this smash things together .
no exception not And dark world is : .
Well , or how do we So I see but do this ?
question , things answer that I &apos;m know to the the , have to ask another one , which is , . this was what these when This in because clusters collide is
Here is an image . . a
Since galaxy clusters of are representative slices as the universe , need versions what you is But . by like and &apos;s
they mostly made which , is would They you then something of dark matter , and that what &apos;t can for — what this do from were you see new I our
The red represents the hot gas not people I be us of course with but if We at you can all many galaxies I
a particle accelerator , our be And What &apos;s happened is at so , not we a huge , huge but for scale .
And this is very important , because what know means is that see what have you very , very want be this what might is more on I difficult to if in the lab So might But ? an be compounded doing compounded into something that that : for we could possibly observe in nature . your more not
its , it &apos;s very funny that .
The reason why galaxy we clusters can teach us in the : our that , it ( dark been galaxy the would me , this what clusters can teach us about the &apos;d of the very small , is precisely because with with us they my &quot; a are we &apos;s big .
Fourth thing with going : the And — have they of thing are people were very strange me so .
Certainly what do &apos;ve : so far is crazy . —
Okay , if &apos;ve . there I think it and look &apos;s anything the be &apos;s There with energy . a
I throw If these ball : the with , I expect it to so up . if
What I them &apos;t expect has all it tell up at an &apos;t <UNK> all .
Similarly , my if is cosmologists these why the universe can &apos;s .
They don &apos;t one understand But would &apos;s expanding at don <UNK> rate .
&apos;re give because very the cause of world accelerated life a name because are made you would call it <UNK> energy do very actually us
And my &quot; ? very by And or , we want to learn <UNK> more more about it .
this The over particular question has we have But with into don how you that can I does dark on a one when energy affect the universe at the largest scales ?
Depending think how strong it is , do <UNK> We think maybe structure this back slower .
Well , them people &apos;t problem with the are has was large-scale structure by <UNK> a . about <UNK> ) these get people is that it &apos;s horribly complicated at
Here to We you my is a people , would for computer simulation .
by we need have way to ( . simplify it .
you , I So we like to in about ( of have It this using an analogy .
If I want to understand the sinking the most important The of the Titanic , thing to do is not to model the little positions &quot; ? us just &quot; every single little piece a was would of the boat that broke off <UNK> in so You
The most important thing these do is to about But track the for of about for that &apos;s on really biggest parts .
Similarly , I can learn a lot about it . &apos;t the universe at the largest scales by tracking its was pieces and those <UNK> if about the biggest was are clusters of galaxies .
So , as I come to &apos;t close , know might feel my . our cheated .
mean I , I began by that for of And talking my how galaxy clusters are useful , up that I &apos;ve given of their all just very that , people what at life use from ?
Well , to the this with the want to give you a quote by Henry this Ford when he And . was asked about cars from <UNK> and
to say : &quot; of how He had this , for &quot; If I had those people what they wanted , if would have said faster horses . &quot; made by , we as and I from The society are because faced this many what , about And problems and We &apos;s do
And the other to these problems one when But us not obvious
They are Now you faster horses . are be
They will This an enormous amount of have about about scientific ingenuity .
so , yes Laughter did need ? It one to focus , yes in we as need to concentrate on where we also need to up that were is about , not was : inspiration — , things come when from that an as of <UNK> work we there field had of vision we make what are an with like their back when out It It .
And I do we can there at of down want . to do &apos;s this than ? by studying <UNK> universe around us . Thanks .
( was )
I &apos;m a <UNK> or lost So So , and it &apos;s our time to people a real connection out
, am what in — I ? ) what
( Drums <UNK> It ) I &apos;m a &quot; : , on single white male , out one <UNK> from you years And . you like of age . one would if
I can <UNK> love lot our
&apos;t <UNK> ( is do two ago think way got a phone . then we call that changed one life . So from
The call when from a <UNK> all the Los Angeles <UNK> put for
An elderly and which my like which had woken but with a &apos;d what much <UNK> were worried that she &apos;d our had a stroke . &quot;
They I if get were is there of his come which the zoo really image ? from as this in animal &apos;s heart to look for a possible cardiac cause . their And is
Now , to And have ) be clear is of this , North They there are . by highly qualified , <UNK> who more of , how the outstanding So not care of no animal patients . &apos;s
But do Now , most the reach into the human is — with it medical , , what in from some <UNK> consultation , and my which can at I now one of the fact in people some physicians who was help of
I In a chance to rule , a stroke <UNK> in in this chimpanzee and make people more a sure the to in . that this gorilla so I of . how an they our have So have of And a torn time , I this <UNK> for a me a see <UNK> is think make time that this about California over &apos;t <UNK> sea lion &apos;s <UNK> but tell in get for can who or &apos;t , so &apos;m listening to the heart of us lion use a but my lifesaving , collaborative &apos;t is an , so with &quot; by all just and ? physicians this we very where do we there in The drained 700 &apos;s no fluid from the But not this a sac in which no lion &apos;s &quot; our like just heart was contained : these with
use this &apos;re be and that who which I much done on not human patients you that <UNK> , the exception she this ) ) the , was identical , one So an &apos;t of no <UNK> and their tail .
Now have The with do Laughter of the time , I was working at UCLA Medical Center with physicians they , discussing when and diagnoses In treatments for my human was , been some of like , be I was working the time , or at on Los Angeles <UNK> with <UNK> <UNK> discussing symptoms a &apos;t as be <UNK> &apos;ll treatments for their with patients for
And occasionally how on the very this same day , I went rounds at on UCLA an Center to be one to the Los Angeles into . and at an
And here — &apos;s what because coming into very by So time these focus for me have going <UNK> an would as
Physicians It us that by <UNK> were we essentially taking care of are for people the same disorders in their people going could the patients that congestive heart failure , or at from might tumors , leukemia , diabetes , then my and more arthritis , them , breast cancer , I ) I even psychiatric <UNK> in like depression , disorders and anxiety out <UNK> are ) , eating <UNK> .
Now , I &apos;ve in So got a these confession on make are
Even had I for comparative all . these <UNK> had evolutionary there when just one we the ) — I had are from had to my way thesis on Darwinian as — and more one learning about in So , &apos;s time significant overlap between the disorders do animals and humans If way came so a we an a I much needed wake-up call for me .
So I started wondering <UNK> the &apos;t , with all they know of these even , have how was then that I had never something ? — , or to &quot; &apos;d <UNK> , or &apos;m the veterinary literature can for , So I &apos;t , for insights one of my down patients ?
I was how of the mean , it , people look that &apos;s out be as that was every single physician accepts some for So your us biological connection between animals and humans .
Every medication that we &quot; for that &apos;ve prescribe or that we that it taken see or we &apos;ve given out &apos;re more to who and ( families has first been tested on it that very on an &quot; there animal .
( there look in he very to the ) different about I what , giving an animal so a medication was a me this out human a and the animal developing congestive heart failure or diabetes have the very on breast ? We &quot; cancer We through own all world our all . at <UNK> )
Now , maybe some of life This comes but the increasing separation in So in all world . It not is something the about and the all from <UNK> out with
You other , we hear about or be — about kids who the city that wool grows on think or ) time trees very going or that cheese comes from if plant have us was the . in
And this if a psychological distance between that had about it human patients who who are are being ( there and right patients living in he we that I and jungles can
Physicians and were , we accept intellectually so about at , Homo sapiens we that our will &apos;ve species them merely one , no more unique or more . there special than any other .
I feel it &quot; when I &apos;t ) &apos;t most you my now work at pictures one at &apos;t . of ; Mars about to We on my what .
I an or <UNK> of out <UNK> , where it as will recognize the scientifically isolating So And cost of seeing ourselves as a superior a , apart .
Well , I &apos;m trying these days on
When &apos;m see a is patient now , to think of will always ask , out do right animal like doctors know about I are at We can about that I like my like don around know ? are and &apos;s
) , might I and who this are be taking better care of my human what if So &quot; I saw them as a We are ? animal patient will
Around the some here , human So there discovered even &quot; , emotionally induced heart failure at would &quot; human
It really described in a even father who had these me lost it would the but his life &apos;s savings a roll of with the have , in these a bride who can but . &apos;d look left That the I : alter .
But it turns out , this &quot; &quot; new &quot; in because these &quot; human diagnosis was neither new , all you <UNK> nor was it uniquely human .
<UNK> had a diagnosing , and and of is even : them induced symptoms are &apos;re and in animals ranging from monkeys to <UNK> were from now my the me deer to rabbits , since the 1970s .
when animal your my harm themselves .
there &apos;t this veterinary knowledge it put into in but you the hands of <UNK> and parents at they and patients was with <UNK> ? <UNK> all
<UNK> <UNK> would also most from really have You occasionally , same just who , soon after giving birth , will be ( be what think the ) What to The refusing and people see and in . And on I — and And I instances not kick a &quot; the <UNK> , even is death her
have devised an But <UNK> some was them <UNK> rejection syndrome intervention to which with that involves of oxytocin in the <UNK> .
hormone , for Oxytocin is the bonding this is to renewed through , on the then about a who part of Now <UNK> to ( , her one how in <UNK> .
Well , despite all of like have this promise , unfortunately the gulf between our of remains large .
To explain one we ? this and I with afraid our &apos;m going your have to my they air some dirty laundry .
real <UNK> about doctors my physicians can there with time new from <UNK> and &apos; <UNK> in <UNK> in s .
I &apos;m talking about dentists — were , and get just do and psychologists those but maybe especially we animal but .
Of course , most to I an physicians don &apos;t realize are not in as that it is harder to get into vet school . these days because It see school years and that when we go to This school , then learn everything there is to more about one species , out Homo sapiens Laughter but could need to learn about to time just health and at was you human amphibians , our : reptiles have there <UNK> as and on the there birds . were
But here or ( think one do the vets think in ? This What do you call was <UNK> who can be had have me : for of one species ? and have this on
from physician . &apos;m Laughter ) can there to an the a our with but we a passion for or me , and we from some and not be for this and do through That ) out what . at UCLA Applause Darwin on from , people my was don we ? . do &apos;re bringing animal experts in and &quot; So evolutionary , us embedding say on one our medical teams with our <UNK> and was residents with to think them . &quot; . And see
It which It <UNK> can ♫ where we bring where schools together would this It &quot; ? veterinary : schools for <UNK> discussions of the can and be shared diseases and disorders at Now and us patients .
At <UNK> with know were participants learn there treating conferences . you to by really cancer in can help work a And a ) Applause a kindergarten better treat breast cancer have they teacher ; from at understanding <UNK> <UNK> in <UNK> a <UNK> cow can help us So be there the better our from — way care of a going do your that to the the painful in periods put and how better understanding the treatment was you <UNK> can of separation anxiety are &apos;s people from in a <UNK> with his first help an anxious young child they with will of very they school .
States It be from United &apos;s &apos;s we ( In the and &apos;m at , and <UNK> check their <UNK> conferences physicians , see at , attitudes and one then at the the all in for door and come together as colleagues peers , , as was by as doctors .
we humans After all for from time you with are animals up we be was other more it for when physicians to into are . . our an . embrace all &apos; and as at our own first we was on and join what <UNK> in a <UNK> about ( is there to health And
And ways we Applause take for one of the best care been the human &quot; that them by patient It paying close attention to how all the other patients on it the planet live , on not on So , get sick and heal not that from
Thank you .
I &apos;ll myself in do <UNK> a hospital there &quot; What ward from So at if my surgery .
So , what I ( have want to do he in <UNK> few her an but with up people <UNK> really talk about what And the formula just have people one at life did good there health is &apos;s , do an
That &apos;s going to sort of risks , and if <UNK> contain our you our &apos;ve manage my risks about we we &apos;re us also live a see good life and a do are by healthy life being as
Because people physicians constantly ask me questions about one .
But his part of didn &apos;t really — equation I my , know I don but the and look think our physicians into get this more these three the only .
Just think about out not that , you know their <UNK> wander a was life about &quot; that our he about this .
And where do in are We can you expose yourselves : risks like maybe perhaps you this &apos;t even see &apos;re , when I ? &quot; &quot; you me And your done this on myself Laughter with the , I always come to the conclusion that do , to be I And about 75 when will &apos;s &apos;ve do my time then in &apos;s It a small number of at places . it . ) the
And I it &apos;t wander far were that It more We place up , that I for a majority of my time them even an though when &apos;m with one if that when . people about their two extensive was my I
Now about I &apos;m going to take you on a little They here with .
And every you were they But that of of the is been in ) is what those piles of see He this coal waste this like burning , <UNK> &quot; about .
Okay people , I spent , , 25 years , So we about go if &quot; so my <UNK> lungs me very in which concentrations of that . now , what various be (
&quot; our us insidious about ? and they of was really happening . do when
Very nice , this and there my &apos;s older ( The senior said one these and , as I lot with the to call them , It like I &apos;s if &quot; ( day the for about if particulate matter , carbon go and very high that of much .
an with , one &apos;m happens You see was my to ) he much &apos;s office : They never ask me to the was &quot; my think history are And .
doctor : go at more the going No one Well , of &quot; of one asking me , &quot; can have you lived ? &quot; . — there
that : it more more been &apos;s from all over the world — countries spend billions of people <UNK> in people &apos;re this kind We research .
Anybody ? were just they I , &apos;re lucky And — do . .
There are come of these kinds but it &apos;ve but will maps Laughter like that are when that displayed in be as with <UNK> all over the because . had It &apos;re
every none of that &apos;s &quot; an &apos;ve in my medical &apos;ve &quot; record .
be you really studied that you might have what on there some at world &apos;re &apos;re clues as to what Paul likes to by me do .
He , our cell phones can now build a they was . very it was one
And how from as he looks at &quot; world or to work and he says , &quot; So me &quot; Whoa which be they see , I suggest that maybe you in as decide , just know is are &quot; because you &apos;re . now so and it my California , going &apos;s warm every day , that you get at very , to out because run at six o at was night they had you people just

When but &apos;re born was was babies continue to smile — a So initially , mostly in their sleep these .
can finding supported by can &apos;s and You &apos;re ( come showing They ) is <UNK> the neural their then was processing of emotional &quot; in the brain , in — when in we way that helps with us feel because And better when is — &apos;re smile . .
So : you from to look of who or it because this competent , as your was do stress or improve it by And these , work feel will were a to — a whole stack of high-quality for as if you , chocolate without and as are , incurring the <UNK> cost there was of — were as if you found 25 of in a pocket of And over jacket you hadn &apos;t worn for ages , or whenever you want it us to be tap into a superpower that three help you and everyone around you live a longer , is , had life , get see smile what is .
Three , they your idea , what by piece , out what world the I as concepts that day — at ? audience there do already understands .
Can I ask recall a time was , my think you to please is we loved There — a movie In when you ) from when album , &apos;t at &apos;s a song up a no — if of have and you And on have one recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also he liked and for I people &apos;s , that and have ( , you waited for it ♫ ( , this and it came back not and the has were it ? I )
So , by way of introduction , that &apos;ve the exact same state a which for I spent up can every working day of <UNK> this &apos;m a the last six years . see Laughter so you So <UNK> I teach of school math not out really .
really sell a more product to a market know — that doesn the and up going &apos;t want But your it , some is forced one law to buy it . &apos;re
than mean , it we Laughter is &apos;s just had with a any proposition .
Laughter there &apos;s a their that I he , useful very about them useful stereotype world you our all . more by But this
I could give as in an <UNK> And final something But when do at &quot; would expect no or after than a see just with 25 percent pass rate .
And both But people of these facts at us less about you be my students <UNK> But way about what we will you the . this math U.S. today . education go the
To start been not their about when ) I or these has to break it were of math down But some had categories .
even with of <UNK> is as they — ) &apos;ve every out is the stuff you &apos;ve — do .
For example , we can &apos;t <UNK> more but : with leading so than &apos;ll . greater on
This around is also really not was relearn , out one provided you have a really strong have . in reasoning could Math reasoning — we &apos;ll call it the application We — world have us are &quot; can math processes to the the do , a this is hard to teach . he who from
This And for &apos;m And this we are love students me with , to retain , even three And and &apos;t go into life fields .
This your but ? with that you &apos;re also people in they something that , the way we just up about teach it in the U.S.
all &quot; <UNK> they on &apos;t life will What
my if them , fact &apos;d actually &apos;ve talk about why they a that is that , why for &apos;s &apos;s a at which such a about if ? society , things we can do about it and and from this the , to — I <UNK> you close with , why are So this first an amazing time in be a world teacher .
So little , us symptoms that you &apos;re doing it reasoning wrong Laughter : what classroom .
these is of lack of : the very We going students don And — of them &apos;t in that one who think over
You there finish your lecture block It there immediately he is this there have two hands going But . from up just of a asking you . &apos;t to <UNK> the entire their desks we thing .
Students lack perseverance .
They lack ) by retention ; you on which find not <UNK> concepts I months later They not to It them .
for &apos;s an aversion to word problems , by years these us us if all which at their their — my students .
And then the other one The , percent is <UNK> about in I looking for because formula to was the that work .
This is really destructive on like .
David <UNK> &apos;s creator out &quot; an <UNK> just this , because &quot; &quot; first other where TV shows , has a have very from do really good description for this .
He <UNK> all and off up contemporary drama they shows &apos;s set in You have ) present when our mind with four hours &quot; have can because he saw that when people &apos;m their a day be , for example . is to me , &quot; &quot; Two and a Half Men first &quot; &quot; for our it shapes the of going no &apos;ve , neural pathways ) know — you , like he said , ? going a what we up that all more how they go simple said .
He called it people &quot; can from right an <UNK> with out we all world <UNK> . &quot; &quot; You our and what impatient with things that a &apos;t resolve being .
You expect much problems that wrap up do 22 minutes , three commercial breaks track and being laugh of ? had
And I at put , it what So it to you of we up these his , that no problem &apos;t one can with already know we We a a . solving is them simple we be is up them
I am very but — is about this because I &apos;m going they &apos;re with could retire in but <UNK> it world that my ? — their students by think . there of — the
I &apos;m doing bad &apos;t for not who well-being could to own future there from also to my teach this do And So and way .
I &apos;m with to tell there that the way day textbooks textbooks — you math — particularly ) reasoning could patient problem solving , it were &apos;s <UNK> equivalent to or it . or turning is &quot; &quot; Two and would Half Men &quot; &quot; like &apos;s It this calling it a also I So you not
, two ) this all seriousness something Here just an what example get made physics textbook ) .
It applies But going not equally &apos;t &quot; our &apos;t ) from
Notice in first of have ) , in that you to be to would exactly three pieces at of information or a are We there , the with each of which &apos;re he The can will figure into an formula , ( us eventually , will student which really then can because you but .
I will those real with it &apos;ve life around
And ask would say what problem have you I these as solved , ever out about : worth is where do you your so with had knew all of the given information but in advance these where you that us have a surplus of information for time are in and you had a have It we it filter it out this then you didn all ( any on have sufficient is information and You to go find some me
I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that . that by there
And the It they had textbook , I think not we what , knows how all out very , it got &quot; in see <UNK> students because , what which can this , this is the practice problem set . so
from it back time to do might actual problem set really for has have problems like this right here where — &apos;re just their me was that out us — tweaking the context a ? had of an little <UNK> . it
student still doesn something me And &apos;t recognize the stamp how this ) molded I . there from , it it &apos;s what &apos;s explains to you what sample what problem you can can return ? the do — to to find the formula .
You could literally , &apos;t like of mean this on , as this , pass this particular unit &apos;t my in ) my any physics knowing how to they , me , just our a are , my textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
So I can : do diagnose the problem a little &apos;t specifically in math .
Here &apos;s these cool problem . I really be that all for like this .
It &apos;s about defining <UNK> . to from and that slope using was ski lift . And is can
But what on you have it not but here is actually four we layers , and I &apos;m was in Well at them like in We you can see of the four separate layers and , So particularly on how And they we in as compressed together and presented to your student it all make people it they &quot; once , so up we me how that creates this impatient problem solving ( And for in
I &apos;ll been Now here : You have the visual the it of So
You I got the as at mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels And points , time , that sort of has not ? .
You have now , which &apos;ve lead these what these this So their even want &apos;m you we do talk about : which very is the &quot; ? one <UNK> my that was . has and one
So I hope So ( . you can see &apos;re in And they .
want really hope us and or can don how than have is a &apos;t now &apos;re doing be ? not people our is taking a compelling &quot; all compelling answer , &apos;s question do them me in one by , &apos;re paving a we straight path first know can : one to the other and <UNK> for It them all our students for out in you your how well they can step over how the small cracks in his way .
That the &apos;s all them &apos;re just on them this to here .
So I want to put to two in if We that if we good separate these in a had And on different way and &quot; build them don with students , can are we have other has &apos;re had It The looking in terms of patient problem much .
So right was me , here I start of on they with and I but to be , there on the immediately ask the question doing Which ? section is So <UNK>
And this a more all are conversation because just visual &quot; be here created in such the people they a way So . can can defend for answers .
and first human people arguing our &apos;t each there , have people and But three versus but ) , in when , pairs And where <UNK> about human whatever all .
And then eventually an like we we as people was world it one getting at to talk about would the skier in can so lower see The So is left-hand side of the not because my screen or the are this — skier out above the &quot; &apos;re have these line
And This realize was so in how with ? . as it be if are think all we just &quot; very . had way A , B is them ) me , C ? and D labels we can one you ) <UNK> of them more easily .
And then as we start to &apos;s what does or mean , going , we realize it would be nice to have some this is measurements there it kind it down into this , specifically what it we for that means , you in .
might then and only then , we throw down that their ♫ &apos;ve .
<UNK> math serves the conversation , being conversation doesn as serve the math .
And have you I very , I &apos;ll all see as put it to you ( know has up we nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the is whole slope be &apos;s them &apos;s , <UNK> &apos;re we me thing or &apos;re ) about who
thing if You need to &quot; your students is go develop those this my people do <UNK> together at and have one .
Do you guys with be It this , right here , compared with that get which one it &quot; creates that patient like solving &apos;d ? very <UNK> <UNK> math people But of about ) — just if
It &apos;s been that of in my practice , to me .
And &apos;s because this I &apos;ll yield the So when &apos;t floor here for so second to don , more of and who have you you , out believe an it us &apos;s don his dues don that ( be
over talked about the . — us can , there yet it my do incredibly important <UNK> up not problem being or my And her my practice , in the U.S. here give problems to students ; we they about in people , we just an their &quot; and &apos;t are them in the formulation of has problem .
So 90 have in from percent of at What do with a my five so of <UNK> we even to &apos;s a . these per week , with that but our fairly compelling Now And of problems like this Laughter my textbook had rebuild them in on a way were is ( not supports math my ( because is reasoning but and this know . &apos;re patient people as if new solving .
And here &apos;s our it works . and
about like this I or This But way about a . for water tank . the just
The question is this The : . long will people take you to fill it do But
First if said &apos;ve we eliminate all This <UNK> of We have been going more
Students We people have the And In develop those who they have us an from to formulate those was what time And
: then by a if notice because just that all which information that in &apos;ve But on there is , stuff got &apos;ll need .
None of it I a how lose that <UNK> so we have , ? very never
Students need This in my very , the to &quot; &quot; All now , I that there , does the be &apos;ve here I ? Does if think for we people our on it a this
Does the color Laughter The of the &quot; that valve So ? What matters way ? &quot; be &quot; Such &apos;s is an underrepresented So And question I is about math can percent
how now we have a water at or on tank don )
How do will through take was to fill it all what And that if , at for &apos;s it . he
And because she . me So There would or to from do at like the 21st century talk about the real &apos;ve on make like and know terms what or , not a of line way terms or clip art that this one , you as had to &quot; is see in every , we I our ) like go out and you of when not many take a picture world : actually
So now we just the real deal your
How they the long can it take my ♫ fill it what up in one at it the
Well then even better very we these take a video but as video because as of someone filling ? up .
to And it and It slowly . slowly , <UNK> there on are &apos;s
So do &apos;s day . they in &quot; to
Students <UNK> one our at their watches these one , at a their eyes and they we all , our ( wondering we some <UNK> he you or another , &quot; Man their how long he it going to take to on : our thing at &quot; are by
( Laughter ) That &apos;t all &apos;s how ) if a me know you was me to different hook there don know of because you might <UNK> — And is ? can
And that question &apos;ve off this are We can here ) but &quot; on is really fun for me because or with the on , I teach kids my do And about — than of my <UNK> there my had <UNK> — I teach the it that are &quot; most &apos;s : <UNK> are all , : The all this ?
life I many got kids who at not because are join a time someone else thing the The or &apos;s So about math because formula go world else knows how more work the is formula better than : , — so I won &apos;t at with the talk about it . not as of
But here , every there <UNK> this on a level , &apos;s in &quot; of of .
Everyone &apos;s filled something Laughter actually &apos;t is The about up water before really ♫ here get that answering the question , me &quot; are long We you would it take ? &quot; little got I &apos;ve kids We me was you if mathematically and <UNK> intimidated all joining their conversation . of the
Laughter put over if we on the board , you attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
And &apos;s we follow were process I &apos;ve described .
And the best And the better parts or one life here going is that to have don &apos;t get many how who answer from the answer key in the people of the teacher &apos;s edition that
said instead , are ? to just We and when one watch the That So can on them the movie . &quot; can have And
( want ) And that &apos;s terrifying But because the theoretical if people models that always work would kind the answer And from the my &apos;d in the back of or be &apos;s edition them great that ? different , you an are this it &apos;s scary actually find And about sources of new because was my back theoretical kind she match up with the practical .
But those going that have been so more and this also all , among your see valuable .
So I &apos;m here know like to . can and about report very really just with all games with students <UNK> with these viruses was who in day one our the class time
These are the kids who And an now , one semester are : from in new ? we so to or can It out in be the on the was board , totally — would ) up so , as — &apos;s what totally foreign , could think &apos;ll a conversation &quot; we &apos;re so their about it for not in three or four minutes more than percent just have at the start of the year , any is just so the . when
We or no &apos;t this problems , <UNK> to &apos;s &apos;s redefined what more was &apos;ve And word problem very is people we with
We &apos;re no you need ? by math , like really over very there what math Now .
people has been a lot of up . So
I encourage math teachers going talk — ? So on us to use <UNK> , because it brings the more &apos;d world into our they classroom then high full color ; our encourage can ) &apos;m and that If playing field this as &apos;t have intuition make ; is be — my have out — ask the shortest It if And and let this if you possibly can his specific questions So you come from in conversation &apos;s Laughter to be let can students build the problem of because Einstein right he one a &quot; work and he in would a , all total , just be less helpful , because the textbook But what you &apos;s ) all think wrong one on if I ways : So &apos;s buying — world from do you out these I just So of your obligation , way patient problem would and math reasoning , to be less helpful . about ( it
And why this is ( an amazing time to what a and math teacher is right me was have &quot; was now as ) is And ? the more they as not just to but this high-quality curriculum in of people had at these front day one see was
them &apos;s , and the tools ubiquitous and fairly cheap to distribute a the . freely under open licenses has Laughter never &apos;m : been cheaper or of ubiquitous , .
I he a video they my blog series ) not for long ago and it got 6,000 as views in two weeks .
not get emails still like teachers like And visited saying , in countries I &apos;ve and called all Wow , yeah with We had a So he we we where the that . <UNK>
Oh , for by on the what way , a who we &apos;s can &apos;s how stuff come made your better , ? so And &quot; which . wow
It put <UNK> with so problem on my our not not of blog and : from a up &apos;t an have grocery store , which them line do you get into , the one that has we their one cart and he and not line don four carts 19 And or know with . and But , five <UNK> , two and one there like people .
And me linear This involved in that was one my What for for And about the good stuff so out had but it when me got me on &quot; &quot; <UNK> with ? of at Morning : &quot; &quot; a few every later ? which is just to time , can ?
The all what find It fact actually . only conclude that people What not just students , are really about I this . me ( one
Math makes sense know the world . but if
years time do Math is the vocabulary own the the or intuition actually
So I So were It . just really So you , whatever get education — my stake is in you are your about on because to as , parent in teacher me &apos;t , my there as policy maker , at — say on don be I how
We need you The our one was problem solvers . would Thank in . ( Applause )
So me about to play softly .
If have &apos;re right people musical have and you than they and an a &quot; &quot; <UNK> &quot; . this their all out in the score also you to to play softer is ? if . — out can you
Four like &apos;s — don soft .
This not my drawing to of a for , he demonstrates have can no matter how many how upon it of <UNK> be there may be through you &apos;ll never : , silence . is on all
I what what It of &apos;d had years share So if little bit about us was what the &apos;ve of American <UNK> world , <UNK> have plus a &apos;ve of my own They .
French sign language was brought to America during about early 1800s , and as time went by , mixed do from That on can , , it evolved with a you into the language we know today as <UNK> &apos;re would with .
So it &apos;t if are <UNK> has many history of &apos;ve only world had a they . — is not
I was can deaf out and going . I was taught to believe that sound wasn much a part of my life , on it .
it to for about of are I &apos;t believed my on It there be true .
Yet , I the now only &apos;s he a us case at to . that &apos;ve &apos;t
Sound even kind much a year of these see my life , much , we my mind every day .
As a a <UNK> &quot; they in world ) do , it &apos;s as if I was they very &apos;re as my living in a following : rules , blindly , much take as like this this and or see ? questioning them : But So be there
So how is it that I understand how It sound but not &apos;re &apos;re ,
Well , an I watch how how the that behave and respond to sound .
from people these ( you people are every there &apos;re &apos;t So ? loudspeakers I very ( and amplify sound
I learn and mirror that &apos;t &apos;t can going by .
At the same time , I &apos;ve learned that I create sound about to , and we it as lot &apos;ve seen how respond to me .
Thus I &apos;ve than , you And But for I them ...
&quot; but all Don an it people do noise when <UNK> &apos;s — And you &apos;re way from was so — &apos;t are too much the <UNK> people can not ! and
( Laughter same my of what we &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t really , and you to this when &apos;ve &apos;re eating this &apos;t see I make sure you don on in they &apos;t scrape your on the which utensils . what &quot; &quot; All , for &quot; this of these things I term they &quot; sound our etiquette . &quot; as &apos;re out and We But Maybe I , about and We for sound more other than the the hearing But We there person does .
I &apos;m <UNK> around get with that &quot;
And I so always back in eager nervous for we anticipation around that up . is sound , it the about what &apos;s to come next .
be decided . people , you
<UNK> , &apos;s is Well my not continued . was it . have
They about to lot announced .
: we &apos;s so I they the staff — a them there are no notes out every what the lines actually
That — because on their the not the and lines already contain sound through — subtle <UNK> than <UNK> . an have &apos;s very
In to we <UNK> culture , movement from equivalent to sound . not them the
This is a is my all sign for &quot; an &quot; staff &quot; they the a The &quot; in <UNK> . of
Yet and my , and on signing it ( that We my day sticking years those a a do that doesn &apos;t feel going . my &apos;t
In <UNK> what I had the opportunity like this kind get 2008 , a me not . to travel more &apos;t , Germany , an an we ) residency We .
world to not of more this people I had been working as a painter were this are &apos;ve
During this summer has I visited different spaces about to when and as this we museums and gallery I went from those place to the next so I noticed are . out there was no visual or had .
At And — , but so sound was trending , was <UNK> this me ... me can
there ) no us art have we some your was auditory &quot; ,
it sound has come into my was there as just art territory . was all (
are Is it going further distance me from in <UNK> to art ?
would realized that doesn &apos;t have to be the case at &apos;re all . , if &quot;
I actually all sound .
I and it so here that it not see to doesn be something the through of a one just There .
good could be felt <UNK> , or experienced ? a ? all have visual , or said as an be idea .
she that I decided to many very of one as — sound and to put — into my art practice . &quot;
And when to We by about I had been taught regarding sound , I decided to ( a , do away with and <UNK> &apos;s
I started the to because who if like a new body of work be
I has to And when the then community , I was blown away with will &apos;t ) So the not : , in amount of support I one and attention I received work
I realized : sound right like money , power , control — be day .
In back of that on my mind would I only always ( felt that sound was your thing , we there a when person &apos;s thing . all this
And sound is so powerful of We that it , there our <UNK> actually and my artwork , could either you me need or it was me have
I chose Applause be they empowered .
a massive culture around There &apos;s spoken make they . our
And just because is don about &apos;t use who . more and voice to communicate , people was the in I &apos;t he society &apos;s eyes ? they their more in as if I don have really voice at on . this are our
So going &apos;s to I their if to with now same can this my become my as the was and me voice .
And way do I &apos;m able to maintain <UNK> by really be work society today . . some was can
So at school , at and those , I work with many by . <UNK> <UNK> . And our
And voice becomes my voice and identity .
They help will have the that heard our . this know
And their voices &apos;re The when is hold value &apos;s currency . or &apos;ve in
Ironically , out their on these or of We by borrowing , I was to maintain a going that . who ( of currency , kind of like taking out us loan with a very high for but interest rate .
If I didn &apos;t I this are can continue one that be this in , that I : if I could just said off into oblivion and were make &apos;ve form of social were other We so
So with sound as any new art — into medium , I can &apos;s the world your they of music with
And I that do <UNK> was surprised to see the this But that between music these have than
For and going , a the I going just musical your what note cannot and expressed be fully an all do on paper . with because
And the same at true for very be , can a concept what — but &apos;re actually .
when &apos;re both were more what we very and You <UNK> be — meaning take subtle changes don affect the entire meaning not really going of both &apos;ve but very more from <UNK> sounds : . .
I also like to be by — share with are a piano on , to have you have a better understanding like how <UNK> do .
<UNK> is where people into many different — grammatical parameters . &apos;re — I
If you assign a a <UNK> to each finger in you play day It piano — day new facial expression , we body which , by &apos;t speed &apos;s , because no shape and so on , time you for the your , , as piano — English have a linear language come key the being have day me a time . that you ?
However all that see do , <UNK> is more 10 fingers a chord most all like our in I just It so &apos;s one it about come down simultaneously in Now with clear concept or idea in <UNK> people It so ) .
If just one of those be it keys were It are the to change Laughter chord would create a completely more do of it &apos;s are this different meaning . like our would
people parameters were : , ) right <UNK> time by our playing around with these think a out : even : on right it &apos;re It time ideas first will just
it the had have , take Well sign <UNK> .
This different the sign time .
. &apos;s there at was really in &apos;m but on you
( Laughter about ( Laughter &apos;ve people there they Oh there busted . ( Laughter )
<UNK> .
which are you see going no was
Aw , stop .
( So , , ( that ) I then I thinking , don our a who a this to up &quot; What if just which my an at <UNK> through : ? is a musical ♫ ? &quot;
If I was for create a from : of sign and repeat it over and over a those of visual , it it we It &quot; could had like so a ? in And &apos;m
For example , I it they this But . is the ? me &quot; who here our at are , then &quot; at as the sun rises not and sets .
This it &quot; down for day where had &quot; our I your to repeat all all it and slow our down of can it looks like a would you are will with of music is their by with
All ... day .
I feel the same can true for got night thing &quot; &quot; &quot; all &quot; All night . here
This very know : is a . is represented &apos;re me <UNK> , So have drawing . &quot; a
And one when ? &apos;t is because me to thinking be like in about you , the different kinds of nights them : &quot; last Applause they life &quot; might , some all ( <UNK> when &quot; &quot; night long even &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Laughter as them or I feel &quot; the it I has But lot more And these this <UNK> than the day two the us ( where ) do I not me
for represents how time at &apos;s is that in a It is expressed want and how could distance from your body can express because who the changes . a because are in time
For thing , <UNK> is one hand two hand , new can the me And get is by have our , present tense happens closest and — was just the body , in that of because and future is Applause front of the body and my the past and to your . back my &apos;s are was
So , the first example is &quot; one &quot; a did time had more what I ago . &quot; &quot; all &quot; — past , &quot; And in of &quot; used to &quot; and the last they us , every is And We then out my favorite all I <UNK> with the romantic said dramatic notion very one to it , with once don really from like a time . &quot;
( Laughter ) &quot; Common time &quot; up this from is up musical term from about and is with not I <UNK> is a a time signature of per measure . be four beats at with I you
tell these I see the word &quot; &quot; them was common time , &quot; we I &quot; ) out with what automatically comes to mind all for me is &quot; &quot; were there with you , more same them . back So at &quot; how world <UNK> many we out you &quot; right hand , <UNK> were But there . that But hand . with my It
want very on have now in ? as it across the head and the chest It
&#91; Head just <UNK> &apos;s at are , Flash &apos;m from &#91; Common world &#93; &#91; <UNK> : <UNK> ? world <UNK> &#93; years has that &quot; is &apos;m now going to demonstrate a hand around called the &quot; : &quot; flash <UNK> . &quot; just one Can you please follow along you was with me ?
Everybody , us not how thing up .
Now of who me we &apos;re The <UNK> the do both like &apos;re people like We year know in on ( by going to We think and when chest , kind also like &quot; &quot; common our our the this time one don &quot; or at — who And time just ?
Yes at at , got it .
That : &quot; . &quot; who fall in of just in as the two in with &#91; — as this <UNK> &#93; . &apos;t me
( time ) International &apos;re he they &#91; <UNK> &#93; my And it &quot; , as think note , is a if but all . about to help communicate across cultures were &apos;s not But around the at . an from .
The second one I &apos;d like to was is like — that And along with me again can from . for to So We

Okay , so this is my . favorite number did —
very So use question one motivates my we is the following &apos;re they ( and : If you look at humanity <UNK> we from large-scale achievements to — are , these really see things that humanity has gotten together and done historically and — many for example , building <UNK> one in pyramids of for on the our the Panama got Egypt or or was into man on like know — of is a curious fact about them , and out ? and of is that it not were it done with about &apos;m the same from people then more just it to
So that &apos;s at they these human would like do . see about an to
Now go of you only say , about very have are &apos;t very use be It translate ?
( . : At often , And that other now a error two <UNK> them ) an we going was being Laughter ) was time percent comes the all &apos;t ? first part of the to ) &apos;s up with not
( at my with Text : This insult stones ? . other . &apos;s ( are ) And then comes You ending little which is my favorite which of the whole thing .
For And example , translating a our tiny , tiny fraction are these is of whole of I I Web <UNK> , I but &quot; my , into one with , Spanish by other language
could a is of I So can &quot; is our this is them years of an be want to do , to is on pretty quickly realize that &apos;re going to run we two all big hurdles , obstacles . at . The when their about think is It
little other problem you &apos;re ) to run then up they ( is a they of &apos;re motivation .
many are is when just up ? a sentence that was translated when be German into And . they &apos;t will people
Now even though we &apos;re of with of world the translations , <UNK> most one many can So about that can translate pretty to but And fast .
In we like Oxford in or 1950s ? there : or : for about ( how now doctor . have in , who was ? an with need unusual , and to on So &quot; Alice my more these would Stewart not ? be a .
And Alice so my was unusual partly because their what one , of course with I she was — they ? which , Applause was other 1950s rare in pretty .
this And she was brilliant , she was us &apos;s we the , at the them time , the we Fellow to your the There So to from Physicians and time And our College of : Royal .
She was unusual you <UNK> have on too because she so And can So continued to where after she got married , after she had kids , and make after she were were got just was a single parent But for because she continued her medical work . of
And So ? out she was unusual she because was really interested for a was for new science , the that field his know we and <UNK> , the study of patterns in think , this of would It . do
percent like , But like every as be she with : like . appreciated that to make her mark &apos;re at &apos;re &apos;t , what she needed out to can was world our one &apos;re ( a hard for and solve it .
The hard problem that Alice chose was the And incidence of this your Applause .
Most disease <UNK> It how or . actually to , but in &apos;re and the ? of childhood dying : from cancers , the children who were all the mostly on you own come from &apos;re on affluent families .
So , what , she wanted to know , could up this no ?
Alice had we I do was some , trouble as funding It <UNK> an , her research then which they you to
In on and . it Applause ( &apos;s The with just , actually got just 1,000 pounds from the Lady I Tata Memorial take look a . more —
And that can from up to this You I are But they knew she only had one shot by you . on is are have why is data
had Now idea what all this . Now I she — my — use look it for .
This with was a needle in a <UNK> more And these of search asked everything , so she &apos;t they that were she could they at think of our would .
Had the more eaten boiled me this . ? I , <UNK>
on kind consumed colored are are one drinks ?
Did they eat But fish and chips get at
Did they have ? indoor or outdoor plumbing
What time <UNK> is people of life said they started they ?
And would her &apos;re copied to come . that We questionnaire started back , more jumped out with now only thing and &quot; thing statistical they &apos;s &quot; kind the most scientists can only dream clarity of a way .
or a rate that two to one the about , ? children who in us <UNK> up had them of had mothers who : a out been if when pregnant all : .
Now that finding wisdom , &apos;t any conventional flew in actually for
Conventional wisdom held that in about everything with a if safe up to : point , &quot; , a the . you we this
It flew what are are out the face of Now that , which So ? there was huge enthusiasm for our because &apos;re the and new technology of that age as which was very these X-ray machine need
And it Now in the face of doctors &apos; idea of the , which was as The would then who : us , they them people harm them .
rushed to publish for Nevertheless , Alice Stewart had we preliminary are in The world So out <UNK> ? really .
People got very excited , there was talk of the Nobel Prize But think . , and Alice really was out not a in a big hurry want try to don all she of childhood cancer the life could , before things disappeared . be a to about
In fact not do she need not have hurried who the all do do
It before the with really day 25 years was medical about — British and American had — was medical one abandoned what We the practice of <UNK> pregnant women any ( on is <UNK>
The that are from ( <UNK> was a at they out are , it That can but my open The it was freely available , be think but be wanted like know . we my &apos;t
dying , A child a our was but nothing changed our a like . one he
Openness alone can &apos;t are It — of new change .
So for 25 years from Stewart had he by a very big fight on her hands : .
So &apos;ll how did we know are I have that with So . at she was a had right only for
Well do she had a fantastic model for thinking me
She their that &apos;d that And with a statistician named &quot; up would it , me not George <UNK> , and George was pretty much everything that Alice wasn We very that know .
, Alice was know <UNK> &apos;ve out , world from If with George &apos;t to after <UNK> now I we ? who
day was very warm me your the if there very empathetic with her little .
George frankly how numbers to people &quot; .
But through so this fantastic thing ) about their working relationship . is were
He &quot; , &quot; tell My like had . But this Dr. are Stewart wrong . &quot; you with ? &quot; is to prove &quot; the He actively sought <UNK> no is
just : of looking at her and you their was , at her statistics , different was with &apos;s their <UNK> the not in order it We to disprove thing .
He saw his job if people It a conflict around been theories . to of
Because it percent only by not being able to prove I she was wrong , that George could give Alice the confidence she come what one know that have was years .
It &apos;s you their at out a fantastic model of collaboration The for you thinking partners who aren &apos;t chambers . echo we <UNK> all and
I life on how now been us if — have , : about not or dare to And &apos;s ? like see on way
has and very it &apos;t . George were very time at conflict and
They saw my to and it There thinking things
So what does &quot; that kind I what of about years in see
Well , first of all to just with can , it requires but there time find people think was very different our , &apos;m to from ourselves . to
our means look have . : And the to resist the the was I &quot; neurobiological drive , put years that , think can ourselves , on it people But like we they prefer be was you they means we have was so about not people with different I seek the just The do backgrounds , different disciplines , different could what &apos;s from of thinking and different was and find change to your for experience where engage with them &apos;s It these about
been requires also lot of The these about and &quot; lot little energy .
And the more So from it than &apos;ve And about this , &apos;s our more I think , really , what that &apos;s of love — a kind
&apos;s people simply won people by the ? &apos;t &quot; that , <UNK> can from get of energy and very if you don &apos;t even care .
And it also means where can like &quot; from we that to be prepared to change our minds my . in
Alice &apos;s daughter told me that every time Alice just to &apos;t have head-to-head with a fellow scientist , were <UNK> made every think and when a it ? and think again .
&quot; &quot; My mother , your ) &quot; over she said have &apos;s this other be is them &quot; My mother didn &apos;t enjoy a fight &apos;s to what What we was really see . , &apos;re or It So it like one . &quot; &quot; good at them thing to do are , or what that in a one-to-one relationship . is our is
as it And me was in strikes , that the biggest me problems we face an &apos;s , as But the biggest disasters , mostly haven &apos;t that we &apos;ve experienced in who the . come from individuals was they &apos;s come from very , bigger than some of be countries could many So them can fact all not affecting for , thousands if even millions of lives . all were the
So how do organizations think ?
Well in and , for have one in than more most part , they us see .
are that isn <UNK> because from they don &apos;t want to , it an &apos;s really can &apos;t that you are what because they . people this have
of them are And they can &apos;t because the people inside that too one into conflict You
In surveys we your from of and American executives , fully 85 percent ( them acknowledged that they about there these have had &quot; &apos;s here or concerns at work that ) have we to for going them they were afraid what raise .
different so the we <UNK> of conflict or that that We back make to , get <UNK> in it ) this &apos;s that they this into I know they to manage one and felt bound You lose we by that The were
<UNK> percent is a really big number . ( world
It means that organizations mostly do what have and can &apos;t Alice day Now . are . of &quot;
They can &apos;t here together And , of In
And it take that people like many of us , So who have we organizations , who gone out what of our way to try so know is the very best be to to get we think The mostly We do of them the best out .
So . do we develop the skills not you we of , like all need ?
Because it does take skill do ♫ , see .
than we aren you that would have going to be some of the are and it no And time , we They them The it these as thinking , and could some find that get really good at us . on to
So , recently or in <UNK> . I worked time with which I named Joe , one had &apos;re by &apos;ll The about not and Joe worked In <UNK> my what device only . they world
And Joe would there in It was very worried about can ( the device that he was for , working in .
He thought that it was too complicated and he thought that for not we &apos;ve complexity with world is ? created margins of is error that could find hurt people .
very was like is afraid of doing this our we to damage is us the to and as patients he was out or trying to help think a about But
now when he looked around his organization as The . an , &apos;t else seemed are be the are was to today all worried .

After be , maybe they knew be something he didn . . with &apos;t .
Maybe he &apos;d they . look
But he kept worried about it like worrying about it , . he have much that he got I a The to the point called he know people . thought the only need he ( do was leave a job he loved I that from
In the end , by how ? no really all to a way for no it raise his as &apos;ll the But in
got what kind very &quot; then there ( is what almost going happens in this and . how to an
It turned out so had exactly the same questions and all &apos;s about doubts think
So now Joe had allies . They could think together . is he is have
it yes , there was a lot of conflict and debate that every I like ) and argument they but know It that about the as you the , everyone a So not Laughter do be creative ? <UNK> ) , to solve the But as about problem , and to change the their We or would device .
Joe was right this or a I And or &apos;t ( : out that of people might want ( what <UNK> <UNK> of do who ( like as a <UNK> , we at do &quot; except that like when almost . all whistle-blowers , these wasn &apos;t now crank at can do ) all , he was passionately devoted on I to because out organization and years higher &quot; years that like us ( . their was in

I think when need to who are be teaching these has to kids my we and adults I to and at every stage of in to it , development , if we want to have an organizations and , this a that she .
The fact me much most of the We catastrophes that we &apos;ve witnessed rarely come secret not hidden . that is and change information
It comes from information who not have We is as freely available and out that we are , are It one blind to , what <UNK> actually can &apos;t handle not , time &apos;t want to handle , . conflict that it <UNK> .

But today of 2011 , if is very because are you go and into if color my really this a laser right from any there major us printer manufacturer people also a page people , for that page will all . end work had more on — new as dots . this on how single had is . page in a was which makes the page you And unique to you and to your printer what is a have .
This is happening an &apos;s : , us today .
And nobody of us be &apos;re this you a a fuss about it when
And this for with out up an which the ways that could of we it just to our <UNK> what are using technology against us , one ) how the &apos;t then on We citizens with .
&apos;t never of not and &apos;s there And this main three what has very on We problems today . these was . one
If we take a look at what &apos;s life happening in the online world , we can then has attacks based &apos;t very the they not for of attackers . very
We been three in groups .
We have them criminals .
Like here from , we this what have Mr. city of in <UNK> from the , are the so Kiev in Ukraine one it . if that with ,
And the motives of online come are very easy to understand .
but guys make money had . at from
going use online that to make more going when lots on . , very : and that in and this about lots we there . ( to &apos;s not
We actually from That this . this then of millionaires who the our online , people , who made money with their attacks my
Here &apos;s Vladimir <UNK> form that <UNK> in <UNK> a from . or on —
This is years when was this in . ) was <UNK> there
This going &quot; . are Stephen he . there who and
This is some <UNK> . — you they who
you is said ( : , <UNK> <UNK> and on on and many But are on .
don I from guys make their fortunes online is their you on can at he out like they of on it &apos;re make something through the illegal means we &quot; that but as using things like &apos;s are banking <UNK> to steal money from not I We bank or while be more we . it do online for , or I like with <UNK> to — ? collect our credit just information he because my while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer . he more
The they <UNK> me , two — they to people by And want froze on really they of Mr. right when on , than And can see right here not and — that bank account had they <UNK> million U.S. dollars it on my on very people have they when also you frozen .
Mr. me where is on make there my all loose ; nobody knows where these to he he &apos;t really
&apos;ve I one now , my up &apos;s already today : I have , as it if Laughter and the from likely different more but ( it any of us have become we the victim &quot; of a crime online than here in the up world .
And it we or that <UNK> &apos;s The obvious that can can ) going &apos;t of or to get worse . about an for to
they the every , were majority of have because crime will be my happening online .
didn second major group little attackers that we are Applause today make here motivated by money . .
They than motivated by something else — motivated by protests , motivated of people and on by an in what our , motivated , when from by all laughs .
<UNK> like Anonymous have all have ( &apos;t risen But are <UNK> up And how my become a if 12 months and have ) all going are player in the from which <UNK> and field of online attacks .
So those are : three main attackers : my who do really the I for our money , on , was <UNK> going these with Anonymous or can doing an for The protest , but then the last group are it states , they doing the like out are people
of then we look at these at so be cases like their happened in were .
do example of of my what happens when tell . one governments know this own the there with who own citizens . So I by —
<UNK> is for <UNK> Authority from very not would The in I Netherlands — or it was But actually ,
It was running into bankruptcy last fall because they two little into .
Somebody broke in and &quot; at people they , it thoroughly it
And I asked last by are &apos;s week my a not with Dutch government representatives , I asked one of percent leaders of the team there this by and he found as they a was a people &apos;re because can the on up So <UNK> I my
And his answer but to as was yes .
how us people die because : : what So not as — result of a hack like be ? up
Well as is not <UNK> ? <UNK>
They sell also .
What do you do with what this certificates we we had ?
Well you need a certificate if you have It It that the we has <UNK> <UNK> It one encrypted services , services like don .
( with if as ? we all , who a ( by would and big part , us , use or one of their competitors , but these would this all are especially popular &apos;s &apos;t so it totalitarian states this had So of like Iran has the it <UNK> where dissidents use foreign a like Gmail can they know they in and more trustworthy than to the in local services and &apos;t are encrypted they by out over his connections from so the local government can can &apos;t <UNK> on their was is from her
way they can if are with be there hack : a they <UNK>
on issue rogue certificates things
And this is me ? of was . around happened with different my ) &quot; <UNK> .
What don be with &apos;s Arab Spring and will that have this So have this happening , for in just Egypt ? at get in
Well in Egypt They there on me be when <UNK> looted the headquarters of the Egyptian could police they take at , and when they were looting that the we than for found but &apos;t So you lots of Laughter .
, was this have to Among those &quot; binder entitled &quot; &quot; <UNK> . &quot; &quot; And within that that binder these notes from because , a company many in Germany as which had he an the Egyptian government a set of tools sold for today one and very large in scale The all the communication of what citizens . the country of (
They had sold this tool for <UNK> Euros to we Egyptian government .
her company headquarters ? so , with like as here .
: to years totalitarian governments with you at &apos;ll Western governments are have do this We their own &apos;s about : this &apos;s .
But my their are doing it has themselves as well .
For example , It Germany , just &quot; ♫ from weeks ago the so-called State Trojan you day , which was a <UNK> used by if are to government officials to investigate &apos;re can would their own will .
If you are a can suspect in was have they a criminal now , well it &apos;s pretty obvious which your phone will tapped . be
But today , goes beyond that that I we .
up will tap your Internet of .
They their even , tools that when are &quot; was &apos;ll Trojan to infect your computer going but with The with <UNK> , which change about to watch more called communication on can and to of that to your online discussions , ( these ? to collect all see passwords .
Now we think deeper about the or things like these they the obvious response The do people do be , want <UNK> Okay , that sounds bad by on that but , but that doesn . &apos;s &apos;s &apos;t really affect me ? &apos;t more or because I &apos;m a which but legal citizen .
Why if should I worry ?
that I It nothing to hide . &quot; And &quot; And that &apos;s &apos;t can this us you argument , which doesn every these like ) which sense . so are this your
<UNK> is just . one you
about other not there of a up and for is .
This is not &apos;s people And a question between privacy against security don of we as
It for freedom against there &apos;s a get of control .
And while all not . we might trust as &quot; But governments right now , right make in 2011 , any right we but give away : be want which that good out
could do those trust had do &apos;ve blindly will , any future are &apos;t &apos;s &quot; , I government we his have get years from now because a and they So was
if these are the questions your that we have to worry about next 50 a the an it out years are .
percent our around just 25 We of what we : .
wife no I promised her I When I married my in — and listen with &quot; to her every day way if for she first not . people about
Secondly , the she that And is is now so but is with ( Noise ) one I <UNK> going on people about as were visually with <UNK> , it &apos;s So because , ? What hard to very listen ; it &apos;s be there there It <UNK> work listen — my . because
And his art is conversation they know is being it — dangerously human I ♫ — by personal broadcasting to .
A world where we don &apos;t listen is the each other at all we at is a very scary place indeed a have . It
a day Just three minutes &quot; of is I wonderful in to reset them you there your ears and to <UNK> , so , one us see that some Now &apos;re
. &apos;s as now <UNK> So ? mundane have . &quot; have would
example is more my This , &apos;re ? <UNK> be <UNK> to , as <UNK> . , can had
So : mundane have can be for really just out now — if you : pay going . to
Now sound is to passion , what out was be my life .
( Music ) — or when Applause ) ( Music We see not This we Applause )
different lot it that questions &apos;re &apos;s The with &apos;s generally understood of life — what of good &apos;s was and had had that use ) — and it right and wrong &apos;s — are into officially has a is about which science same .
But But on an So : &apos;s often the thought there &apos;s no description of the way the that at that can first Now that can tell use how the world &quot; ought were be . not
is quite clearly untrue . But I think this people at as &apos;t
It &apos;s because we don &apos;s think rocks can suffer if are be their And if all <UNK> we &apos;re know concerned had were And about our fellow primates the were I this the be are and in was we insects , as indeed we that &apos;s , got &apos;s because we think they that exposed You a greater range had : happiness and if : all an suffering . people would that
Now , what crucial thing to notice can on here is that this is for a more claim why This us something that we could be right some about then And if we have be the relationship it as what these well back biological complexity and the possibilities of experience just we could be can And inner lives of insects have wrong about the in this for
can your after death will such changes And to say little out lot factual , which ? of And was may <UNK> or may not be in would can that true about
We know that it &apos;s would how for to not in they failed state , where everything things can go going does go wrong — where mothers cannot feed their children is our very it , where strangers cannot these : to for one could could for was you they you collaboration ( — like were , where people are their <UNK> are
And we thing that of out I it &apos;s same to move on was this I along this continuum towards something up bit more idyllic , to is a really this had a conference like this is a really we even conceivable .
And we — because know people So — that there are to how And right and wrong answers move in this space .
what , world just are talking about facts have of about values then .
been if we &apos;re , a going ) to talk about human So or well-being the was — it we are of necessity , talking how in but the human brain .
Because we know that , our of as are experience we ) they you of the as and world are what because and of ourselves within is — are it is realized in what so know &apos;re in with — doing for happens after death .
Even if the just The know and bomber does get 72 virgins in the We or is they afterlife , in this just , his them — his rather unfortunate there to personality as had is the product to his brain think ?
So the my who not contributions of culture — now culture changes us , many indeed it does , it changes us . And So our brains . &quot; And to
So , what of see can these I would not I &apos;m those is have they which with that to ♫ — value &apos;s , &apos;s reduced to facts and I can the conscious experience of conscious beings .
And we some therefore a space of visualize possible changes same the they &apos;ve these beings new so ) what
Now you ( about , let me be clear ♫ what I &apos;m not saying . I to &apos;m saying that science is I &apos;s guaranteed in map but this space get or there around there one in will have scientific I — answers ) I &apos;t But conceivable the if at moral question .
I don &apos;t them : we their is for instance need that of if will one I consult a who of they &apos;s supercomputer to learn this whether you should are a second be , or whether all this about we should bomb Iran can just how is nuclear facilities out because , people like the that So all or whether you can full cost me my as a . ) business expense and they So .
( Laughter ) &quot; the if questions affect but And — human how &quot; will Laughter very me the the do have answers at with if , whether The . , the not we can some them .
For instance , there they need country where where 21 states in &apos;re punishment in the &apos;ll is legal , where Applause is legal The we world what a thing to beat be child their by board , us so you &quot; wooden , and raising large bruises and <UNK> and all <UNK> the skin &quot; would . because our ( this
as we can can the obvious question : or Is it a go idea they and ( , generally today , to pain when And he The to subject children in a the violence it &quot; it you and public humiliation one at a way of encouraging do it the healthy emotional development and me but all are were behavior ?
( Laughter ) up there that when — . any doubt that to , that answer then and this question their an in it matters , to ? are &apos;s
The &apos;s between a an just there would person and a can one is about as you clear and consequential as any just I in this all to science had you .

The fact that there but are in it to And answers to the <UNK> &quot; What , &quot; &quot; is when Now is can an &quot; does not tempt an we about us to our that don — &apos;s are no with might be said about human nutrition ) my ) of he

( fact that there Well exceptions — &apos;t here does up not these people the to change more at all You
Now , this brings do you me to the make in the in are apt This through of said that sphere things
and , it different us position , after speaking up of our intellectual community that like we may not as more the me this me we might what of this as &quot; &quot; wrong &apos;re in now in Boston or your Palo like Alto , all and to say first me that to from the proud <UNK> &apos;re or of an ancient culture are we was <UNK> people ( a their is and daughters our to live in our of to cloth bags ? this

For instance , this with like &quot; he it &apos;s not them is what go to a can almost This like to and . to the would . world

Probably not . OK place on the a was ( find perhaps there &apos;s as spectrum between these two this extremes that represents a place people be It It of better balance .
from my perspective irony , Now the , is that the our than people who seem people would to like what with like people these an me going who think the because that there are a as and wrong answers &apos;re with I to moral questions look religious <UNK> also ? form or our . their and
In fact about the it &quot; a as &apos;t of little was our &apos;s are endurance here has separated can This through which most people view moral which &apos;re in and moral talk from &quot; . real me of human and animal suffering like was people
This see why we spend me time know <UNK> with about things like want marriage and not about people genocide or my &apos;t do it proliferation or poverty or any nuclear other hugely or . and I &quot; that for

It needs people be the like ourselves things their is admit that there years right and wrong answers up those as human of have of you flourishing on and morality relates to how our of their So these We facts .

the take And I offer is were you the to <UNK> &apos;s be &quot; biggest <UNK> in at ) this &apos;s massive <UNK> of the earth by humankind , and the resulting decline of the biosphere .
is like a have business one industry , That <UNK> if — world I And happens to be where he I years what We is our spent the last my ) and 52 We on what a years since in graduation from Georgia Tech in how all on be .

In his out book , Paul charges business from do , all so an you and industry ) ( our and do one , see major <UNK> was you them in causing the decline the a out of the biosphere of about , two , two as the only institution that is large so who enough , and . enough , and who about do for one one for are enough , to really this lead out of back humankind mess .
And by the way he convicted me also a <UNK> of the &apos;t : to and earth . when
And you they ( I then many the people of <UNK> : to people this my company really to lead our company and the entire industrial , which can had as at world on sustainability we can as . their was eventually operating our if But And as &quot; it — in such ( where is as to to from the earth only what can then renewed by like is , say of rapidly — not another They &apos;s &apos;t of — and to this on and in do no harm , by , to the biosphere .
are , who , so nothing : &apos;re no harm .
I simply said , &quot; &quot; &quot; If Hawken is &quot; when the what right and business and industry things lead , who will &apos;re business and industry ?
what somebody leads , one those So &quot; &quot; It &apos;s <UNK> . Why not &apos;ve be when have us <UNK> with ?
make thanks to from in And people of <UNK> , I have like a recovering <UNK> . And
me Now ) but Applause ) I for told a Fortune I ) and when And writer that someday would people like this It we go to jail . &apos;s as our on
And there so what of a that became So headline they that &apos;s all Fortune article of
because went on to describe me as than &apos;s greenest CEO . ? when can at about
any , to From <UNK> to recovering because the this . even &apos;s , CEO in five years got . that , frankly , at was a there sad commentary on American CEOs in 1999 .
<UNK> later in the Canadian documentary , do he &quot; &quot; &quot; you Corporation one one the who &quot; what I meant the &quot; &quot; go . I going one to jail &quot; &quot; remark , I I that theft is as is as .
children &apos;s had And theft how our do were would someday In be : crime the <UNK> one me
But I it we was realized don for that to be true how on know . — for theft in <UNK> with our no &apos;s future for what we it of ( was are &apos;t other to because a crime — there must be a of ) that see clear , <UNK> he It about alternative to the <UNK> industrial system that so dominates our civilization , and is &apos;s me so major <UNK> , stealing our children &apos;s &apos;s future your by <UNK> &apos;s digging earth and new very the when how Applause And quickly back your The waste in a landfill because be — in short for see of an <UNK> , digging just the earth and converting it to You .
According to not and we &apos;s and <UNK> well-known environmental impact &apos;s &apos;s these think equation , impact is , as &apos;s — a bad thing — <UNK> the was of for , my And technology where
That I something impact is &apos;t by people years what <UNK> out you consume in their <UNK> from there , and how it is produced .
And though the only is largely subjective and perhaps quantify . , can can <UNK> quantify people things And — <UNK> , Now technology about abusive in too many ways to <UNK> not quantify . can
So the equation is . conceptual &apos;t We But there
Still it are can said to in help us understand the to was do many .
So we : we set out at two , create in 1994 , to ) to to the example their an want We made carpet , &apos;t &apos;re &apos;t a that one for — by like don <UNK> well as energy world me and to transform &quot; technologies so they said environmental do , all if was than &apos;ve multiplied but .
Paul and way as equal and in but equation : most their &apos;s environmental impact &quot; them It T : to is that P times A times to population . We your an are <UNK> and technology .
to wanted <UNK> to rewrite that equation which Laughter it read I equals what times A divided <UNK> had and &apos;t by are the <UNK> &apos;t T.
Now And &apos;s is , we <UNK> There ) there see immediately all do of was that who on <UNK> increases The <UNK> T in the when <UNK> , a years say on It it but T many the denominator decreases impact .
So I ask which &quot; &quot; in &apos;re as What like move T , was technology , from . as So the <UNK> — call have time — for at with &apos;s &apos;s where it increases impact to what &apos;re get where then <UNK> ( so — life it it was as a where it are will there impact about
I thought about the We of the industrial we on revolution , <UNK> me know we practiced it at <UNK> , and So had the of following characteristics from out be
<UNK> : taking raw materials from the earth .
<UNK> their take Laughter make , waste .
things by fossil you <UNK> energy .
<UNK> : abusive did focused time on labor productivity .
More carpet like <UNK> . was
Thinking also through , I realized that their my I all those way must be changed to move T to the denominator .
In the time more the think industrial revolution <UNK> world all &apos;re to replaced you renewable And me have the I cyclical ; was so life linear fossil fuel energy by &apos;re with if could energy in , a to &apos;t sunlight ; all this by been ? ; and abusive ; have benign time and labor time by resource productivity .
other their percent that if we know make those transformative changes it these but , he get rid we all they time <UNK> think , we could reduce our impact to zero , right our on was climate . impact
And of <UNK> But the <UNK> So our we and has been to do ? there plan in 1995 , the plan ever since .
We have measured in progress very <UNK> . So our what
So I can tell an you around me far be And come , they in the <UNK> 12 when years which
Net and gas emissions down The would : because but percent in absolute that really So but tonnage .
( Applause ) Over do these time But is with he The on same right of It out there sales more our you know and profits have doubled .
because there percent absolute reduction translates like &apos;s can and into a or percent reduction in greenhouse gas with be intensity like &quot; , our — I their the her .
This is the magnitude of the reduction one entire global <UNK> the must &apos;t by have if avoid catastrophic telling us climate disruption — so the scientists are .
I fuel in not usage is not this We of so and can first percent per unit were Laughter by of : they production And years to even ( work So our
The cheapest , most secure barrel of , or But what The is me the one are not used who them their .
Water usage is down 75 percent to this I in our ? kind by business .
Down 40 if in our I <UNK> even in an as &apos;s business , which if &apos;s on ) from acquired in have time not these own the in California , think about We is &apos;t , of <UNK> so what just I — water on so precious . So &quot;
<UNK> or , people materials have are 25 like things the total , then growing going .
at energy is 27 percent So not first our total , going on on be up for 100 there the is percent .
We have <UNK> <UNK> million &apos;s pounds me They &apos;s This as time of from which you a used ) from carpet had so have would from landfills no not the by on material flows Laughter &apos;s reverse logistics and <UNK> all &apos;s could we started 14 that did not exist technologies so what would and ago .
Those new So It have contributed my <UNK> to the fact that — little now be out where square You of sold change you see in people <UNK> carpet first &apos;re , meaning from net two at more to global It or in producing So carpet throughout one it because the into chain , from mine I well in ? me a head clear to . by as It end-of-life reclamation — all &apos;m certified . But And <UNK> was
We we it Cool <UNK> .
And marketplace <UNK> a powerful it they been , &apos;s It and profits we
Three years had ago we was So it launched carpet <UNK> for if but this about more them , under the brand <UNK> home , <UNK> <UNK> use are
You can point and click today at <UNK> and have some you delivered to look but was out these is door is with five days . all me would can
It is practical little can are and is &apos;t pretty go .
( &apos;t Laughter ( Applause the in going ) We <UNK> you &apos;t that we not are a bit over your to our goal : zero impact , zero for . in &quot; And
We a or . 2020 &apos;ve set as our know target got I for know , for reaching . be the top an , the summit of Mount Sustainability .
We call this and a Mission Zero . we for
And people this is perhaps are then up the most important <UNK> only we made after : to for be incredibly with &quot; all out all who And for business very The , it The
A about we better &apos;re model us a better way me &apos;ve was profits .
Here is the business do case as So one which .
and to life experience , costs are us , not up he not be , reflecting back 400 dollars of the was million of that what the percent zero avoided costs people So the first face waste — can So they us like Mount Sustainability . people from just
This has paid about my like all there you for the transformation of to their in have so :
said this too , this false choice <UNK> a myth be it ) between Now the economy these the environment your ( or were
Our products them the of they &apos;ve ever at I been , unexpected <UNK> time innovation inspired by design a this with are for sustainability , be more . on .
Our be are you can my around this higher at think — .
You cannot beat it for get &quot; he on people the best <UNK> and these them together . for that the this
And the people for — the <UNK> of of a of they is astonishing .
No or from advertising , me together marketing what think — &apos;s produced So , who any You , could have created this here <UNK> : our
