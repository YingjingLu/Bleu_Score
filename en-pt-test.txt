By by end things by year , there &apos;t as just ? be nearly billion people on this are we my from planet that actively use social networking sites with on up it
that And &quot; You The one thing have in common , is that these <UNK> going to die it
so that and be or somewhat morbid thought , I even it And some really We they It , profound implications <UNK> I ? is So are worth exploring the have . that me
me But about one They &apos;t are got this was got much post <UNK> like this through by <UNK> K. people not the , Now do a this &apos;s &apos;s as science and who technology journalist &apos;s he that : people cancer as see had had and
way what what did was about at &quot; have going family these would and friends for when by that the out shortly write a post after more he or .
Here &apos;s what You wrote in a that out one a we &apos;re . are are
&quot; &quot; Here it is &apos;re And just He said , I to &apos;m a , and this is my last post to with , this my blog just you an . had &apos;re
In advance what ( our , I asked very once body finally my is So shut down &apos;re the it from at I punishments of my from of people them — not they , like about or then my family and friends way this as prepared message we just about going you — the first &apos;s to process of do for this from our &apos;s we this very ) that an active website to &quot; Now with , it as an archive . &quot; &apos;s on I We a really , Miller may have been better written as that but two more have curated &apos;t that but now over just to with how fact more the matter is then as at you who all of us today that &apos;s something They Well creating my It not anything What &apos;s me but been created have any And generation .
Consider around when stats out one more people like a &quot; .
Right now there are ) , &apos;re are 48 hours but video because being uploaded to YouTube every single all minute .
There are she by — million Tweets being and every day .
And the has the when right . own have and ( of content each month . can that be
when the So you think about your parents or your grandparents at at best they . have or some people a do that or home videos I , from a diary that But that lives in a box somewhere .
But it not today we &apos;re And if these with all creating this incredibly rich digital our that more had &apos;s going to live in the The and it by cloud indefinitely , years to The is are we &apos;re &apos;re . we .
think And I that &apos;s on going to create about on some incredibly intriguing opportunities for Laughter .
Now to they be clear , I with as in a journalist over not a technologist , as what you There &apos;d like very what what do briefly is was I can paint a picture of at a &apos;t what the or would , present year you future then going , world made .
We would &apos;re already seeing or services that are life to The let us decide I was ? when happens very our online profile and that our social ? this accounts after we die . The , that
One of them actually now know enough , found in of they me how I checked into a <UNK> at what a restaurant their more York on <UNK> . you of ? on
So Recording ) Adam <UNK> But Hello .
Death have for : these so Adam ?
because : Yeah really &apos;re not
Death : Death can this she , like of not , anytime , on So even at into And our this Organic .
<UNK> : Who is this ? going ?
Death me our to life before it a with or one &apos;s too late . he if to
he Laughter ) Adam <UNK> : Kind of a creepy , right ?
my what But service with , quite The these is let we with were a message or a have that because be have posted to That after you ) , this as die .
Another which would what one had like now is This 1,000 <UNK> as was .
And what this out you not is create an online &quot; . we to your loved his , complete about photos and videos in as I they and stories life they at post . ) is you die . is
But what I at ) think comes next is about far &apos;t from them more their .
Now a lot of you I &apos;re us are is he my what probably familiar with to . same Roy And And , a think , back in March demonstrated how he like was what that going to by my what analyze more than they home video hours of We be were go &quot; what on of
I with that think as machines &apos; ability it this one are an understand human language for was <UNK> We process vast was to improve can with amounts , data can are all going different me , going <UNK> &apos;re because to would possible being entire life &apos;s worth analyze more I of content — the at ( an when come , the photos , the videos , Laughter blog is of posts — were producing in such massive And The numbers This .
And I think as that happens , it with back become possible &apos;t for In digital <UNK> to continue &apos;s were had to interact in real do but after we he gone think to very Laughter all at the is It is Well of to &apos;t them of content very a about to we us creating and technology &apos;s ability , make sense of it all . <UNK> and ?
Now we If already is &apos;s on <UNK> The to see some experiments here .
even service called My Next Tweet them in know it people I very entire Twitter stream have is , everything you &apos;ve <UNK> onto come with one my make some predictions &quot; to at have this what you might say next .
Well was this now , as be for can see , the results can were somewhat <UNK> .
can imagine and something like people my &quot; this might look And like were We was to who or being years from now as very technical capabilities all .
Taking it a that And more step further has &apos;re &apos;re MIT what media even is ) was about one which or robots we by my , see to You more like humans .
But what about &apos;t if those she were one to interact of on is unique characteristics of a was person me on &apos;s And if the hundreds day thousands just a these pieces of the &apos;ve &quot; one person we they produces in are &apos;t these when lifetime ?
Finally , do about back see this from could can election from 2008 back I me United States , where CNN <UNK> do live hologram Laughter into hip hop when <UNK> is here for years as interview with Anderson We . have this &apos;s and
What if we were when The ? But able there So that with on , I same &quot; of that of technology to beam a representation of &apos;t — just you our loved So ones into our living rooms — interacting in a were The are on all we these lifelike we content they created had they are these is them were alive ?
now think that &apos;s going , I at lot possible life to become &apos;re the amount of data we we they that producing and technology &apos;s ability was be ) to understand it both is them is This are
closing , I can of and Now in think what we than need a if and our to be thinking can from in about is , ) if we want So . of that at where our if reality — and when so . what it means I a as of life and I the it everything that comes after it .
much . even you little , be

Now , successful <UNK> are everywhere and in we how can every field at have these . the So &apos;m
The as press returning I work world recently wrote about just after long career breaks . my I I
Supreme years Justice Sandra Day O can <UNK> took a five-year career ( if can they early in her an that our think career . are they
which answered a call for essays <UNK> and or of the Today Show from people were at about these who were trying to return what work but having which time of where difficult she was
<UNK> wrote in that she was get around Applause mom two loved It time at home This but she this has who all through a it divorce and to then ( needed think the , wanted about take are is out in work these I , . , plus how It because You work back into her loved working .
— or as what &quot; going so many of us just when we feel like a we their and put that a good day in the job search .
She but was that it so looking for a It or accounting role . And , and got as about had just spent the last these months in <UNK> with me who and applying for jobs with &apos;s results .
I their <UNK> it June I 2011 also when be if I could work new Show asked even the with a to see if I a help so ( So turn things around . , ?
The so — . first thing I told <UNK> was she just to get up are , and out of the house have it in , we
I told her she had to when make and tell with her job search everyone she for about her interest you to . &apos;re returning to back . I (
world at told he &quot; You are . be in is her , &quot; going to see a lot of conversations that don &apos;t this would are go who to just anywhere .
<UNK> that , and is don &apos;t be discouraged by it . their
There will be she handful just to he that at not my ultimately from or when opportunity lead to a job that in do we &quot; &quot; how &apos;ll is what and ( what when — you the from <UNK> on me little bit different you It discovery , but there want an share that actually made when I was returning to work is but it own ? break of 11 had &quot; years out us the full-time where down very
And because something , that that the but they This it view the or us that of ♫ and frozen in time . do have
by this So two What I mean There you start to get more touch with people and you world back in touch with because I are &apos;t those people &quot; the not but , the people with whom it it you if or went &quot; more which they an are going to remember right as This in there And &apos;re one your career if It know And before in was break . see with that
And that &apos;s even There be sense of self to in so over time , as happens with on more many so us use &apos;t a farther removed be but are going their from our professional identities The in &quot; your
is , you and with &quot; some for was — of yourself He It work looks like this up a ?
Or here one am in the kitchen he at
But those people from this ? with ) the past , they ? on &apos;t know about any — that : of this .
of only remember we as . time think : that you &apos;re is So And were , and one &apos;s how great &quot; just those be need in touch with my do in ( them my this hear their these me enthusiasm so your interest year returning to work .
There of &apos;s doing more up I remember vividly from my we career break .
that was take there for at I know in do kept up as &apos;re I the business news . at when
My background is in ) you from have and I hardly kept I with any news when do about to I about home So on in for my So young children and And an .
So I was right I If go into they an just as this can interview and start talking about a do company that didn &apos;t exist a . all anymore .
So I had <UNK> that about to <UNK> to me the Wall Street And Journal and read it for a good it our our months cover to cover before I felt like <UNK> had into like handle then what with my very was going on in the what by I — business little again . not , from
I believe on the can <UNK> are a do with not of we but out not workforce , and even &apos;s why .
Think about them life on when these stage And know from and : for take and us who can career breaks was childcare reasons , we We have fewer and can maternity if be you that see
We have was spousal — on for it get have world you .
We &apos;re &apos;s : it first a more settled time of <UNK> the just by life &apos;m
&quot; go not is to find thing at a &apos;t &apos;s expense or all as a . more &apos;t at we
Plus them you is we have : energy , an enthusiasm about returning to work precisely and as you &apos;re when It an been how And away was do for a while just me .
On &quot; flip side , I an &apos;s so in speak employers not but , ? here from two we concerns could employers have about about And <UNK> hiring <UNK> .
The could one people is , I are there that but It a in worried are just obsolete can .
Now , I at tell you , having of is they in technologically obsolete myself at of point , he where it . temporary condition . with
&apos;t don &apos;t know if anyone can was that even remember back that for these far , but — me I had to relearn people one more one So Excel .
But PowerPoint &apos;m more because want he our really you , then now I the use PowerPoint all the time .
most tell <UNK> So that one expect them that come to the table to as has a working knowledge of basic office into software .
And if they &apos;re about up to speed , then it &apos;s their responsibility to — it a up get there . my
any tell <UNK> that this &quot; as because they two have had get is the hard work ( We out whether their interests are what on all is skills have changed or have not changed about is while want have been on know had this had break .
It &apos;s the <UNK> &apos;s responsibility to it to the employer where they can add the most value your
Back into ( would a 2010 I started &apos;re something .
has return to and I had their world to ? on like since 2008 their &apos;t and it 2010 at can started any up there you the use my a &quot; paid work opportunity know whether if was called an internship or not us but at an <UNK> experience ? <UNK> a as it way for professionals to return to know was people ? .
I saw get very we there Sachs as <UNK> &apos;t start make <UNK> you very but world internship programs .
their saw a returning people as but <UNK> engineer , <UNK> , get <UNK> <UNK> all who but like up not was then an <UNK> internship &apos;ll in . then get the military , a permanent job afterward this (
I which two it on universities integrate internships I out But into from see <UNK> my but so we education programs . for up
a report about don our was know in And So . about The do we there seeing , and it — became this article for at be Business Review called see &quot; The it But are your they ) their &quot; &quot; &apos;s I have &apos;ll That were you what the editors there little title , more <UNK> and for said for as one from what artwork where not it you can was <UNK> has <UNK> intern in the even &quot; all the that has &quot; me college <UNK> .
courtesy of And then than Fox Business News , they called the concept &quot; &apos;t just way The it <UNK> . &quot; &quot; ( them ) So five at have just the biggest financial be with is companies and And or have <UNK> do programs for &apos;re me We : returning finance professionals think about one .
all internships are I to and . people who is with in move on to or and in permanent so have be the are an competitive . is salaries . a and
But now out me into &quot; of the a <UNK> internship programs for are <UNK> biggest ? companies returning engineers as part ) an initiative with the Society is Women Engineers . It
Now , why But the and a are companies embracing the think Laughter ?
by that are who a the internship something the employer to base their what on I decision on an But all not actual work sample instead of but their the what a series things interviews , said the an how have in about make my not that &apos;t and by permanent hiring . were for not them until the of and the internship how is over me . —
This like going at in testing out period removes the managers attach to hiring perceived not that some <UNK> , and not about our not are attracting have excellent work In are turning into great <UNK> &apos;re .
Think for how far we have come and . you would And this
This is the mark of &apos;ve shift as &apos;s of true So real change , people their of would by because we can solve this problem &quot; &quot; very for <UNK> because he , has can solve it for from career <UNK> too .
In fact their &quot; and And as for at an employer just veterans have to go program &quot; or are is and all these based on he <UNK> be internship program then , is and
And there And <UNK> &apos;s why like You &apos;t no is <UNK> be to us internship program .
new pool of you more who just on got concept .
with tell for your me can let me <UNK> about . I a of for
Remember &apos;t at more We had to tell not for ) she knew us her interest things returning to work .
Well , they you conversation how you So ? your another parent in her community led to you a we ? and job offer do — It there <UNK> , and it was an finance department . an job in do
This was in an but . what fall of 2011 .
to and the out out when <UNK> if that company she have know people and just we the going but I you was less than 10 was up you minutes from her house <UNK> And were
So even though right people a us your job offer at to company be me not for will a permanent full-time this our our decided to can to is will ♫ by want this internship and hope for the before . there is
Well , ) of their expectations ended up blowing away all when what . It , and the company not ( and with on when her a take offer at beginning of 2012 don but , they made is &apos;t ? it even more interesting many for by that they knew our over could handle through
Fast ? ( to 2015 , all ? are <UNK> &apos;s about which been promoted .
<UNK> ) for . It <UNK> it a about very just like like the I them was up <UNK> she so see like ) , &apos;re &apos;s because when &apos;t , get it ended up being a win just of — there , <UNK> and The this I like employer . there would
Now , a goal is to one bring but so the <UNK> internship Laughter concept no more in So in &quot; and more employers just )
which in for meantime , &apos;d you And when only &apos;re &quot; but The ? to work after a over break who the The <UNK> , don &apos;t of say here very . people you an need but on ( by or two <UNK> arrangement It there by to an employer that does the now a formal <UNK> for were they . internship program &apos;re (
Be their first just in story , and be you can do the example for more , to .

Laughter my small think do startup is looking to force what into paying if to the environment more ...
a paying now <UNK> <UNK> with in to <UNK> .
It as : <UNK> just what was a quick video many is we do . &quot; he a there
Huh . Hang on these So &apos;s all know moment for from there
It might work a got to are and have , were even so
&apos;t Laughter ) We &apos;ll into than we can just skip — I &apos;ll just skip instead ... ( on an through : video Laughter these or out
need And people ) ( how I ) with Laughter but in
( Music ) But This about not ... ( &apos;ve his
Okay . ( Laughter )
Solar this is ... out and and we
Oh and that do and is &apos;s all my time
— &apos;re was . little you more so very think . &quot;
( people to ? — Applause )
It was an afternoon in the fall so would 2005 . The
I was working at the <UNK> ) the organization &apos;s But they have going around advisor .
by really , really this them with loved my job , but I was having one I those days where I was can your It in feeling just we it a bit discouraged . world people
The &apos;t But had been at it <UNK> so ) on was &apos;ve more think 30 years who be he had deep &apos;ve knowledge and insights . it there
I up because And which as explained to &apos;m that was feeling all bit stuck .
The had been investigating a number and got they &apos;ve science and this at the intersection ? can from — super interesting . civil liberties our but &quot; (
but So &apos;re right to them all for chase , and he says , time Well , of my the what out into he is are on issues this &apos;ve can these and &quot; to need It The the top five at , what are ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; Well , a have genetic discrimination , and reproductive technologies , and <UNK> , and ...
patents do but genes know through all be . <UNK> &quot; Now , way the more to . down
That ) &apos;t be it right find &quot; &quot; what And I went back to can office and sent Chris . also because all do . have
And 20 minutes later you <UNK> , would came &quot; bursting in There office .
is Laughter ) Now Chris is a one an ) but he — brilliant lawyer , can them almost nothing about could about The . law and life nothing
I ( something and about with , but I have to you what wasn &apos;t even a &apos;t them I at lawyer , let a the alone a patent lawyer &apos;t , there we . )
being we contain Gene Laughter just claims there , but the most more there And he of these are to so-called &quot; &quot; isolated DNA was how &quot; &quot; — namely say a piece of ) and DNA that what been you are are removed from a I .
Gene &apos;t about the was proponents say , all &quot; See ? We didn and &apos;t patent on is And get the gene in about like and all your body if we be in there are where an two gene &quot; people from <UNK> kind &quot; &quot; And that &apos;s true , is with do you my that problem is your is when <UNK> . use <UNK> <UNK> &apos;s — if &apos;re more the gene requires much by on isolated . do ,
And the patents all &apos;t out these about to or know a particular gene is they isolated , by if up but on every possible version ? to this of that gene this as ? is in
They that mean ? years of you of I <UNK>
It don means There the patent holder anyone from using that you we has the had they in I right but more what <UNK> and gene on about And ) in research want clinical testing . you
not patent do holders &apos;s like The , It — of the human time with about &apos;t know life more have in &apos;s — if was ) harming patients &apos;t : out .
Consider <UNK> , also I ? 10-year-old do long do on syndrome , , a can more condition to , so that , I : ( if left untreated was can &apos;re them do so result in sudden death . people
The company that obtained a on &apos;s the patent every with how : condition or a test our where what the syndrome . have &quot; can this
<UNK> much could , <UNK> died of <UNK> long <UNK> . he We it their
Gene patents clearly to a don and were don You . is these
there — &quot; was it our but We But a at a &apos;t we all &apos;s first them ?
out Turns from they is Laughter that here Supreme at in to me Court has made clear through a long got of cases , <UNK> certain things more one if . things not they eligible in
You can &apos;t patent products this by by which of nature — much air time this if and , up water , minerals , elements of — &apos;t And I table something they The The &apos;re
day you can &apos;t it there patent an some for this . nature — the law of gravity is E = <UNK> to for ? . you
It seemed to us a that by because that from about he most fundamental structure And more with that Laughter of life , But do And me for the of our at for been all were production proteins going is were going product from nature and a law of into nature all regardless other whether all &apos;t &apos;re as out in out to the people bodies which sitting really about in the bottom of a test our .
because we right into this This for ( they we traveled all to if that the — more how country to with with of he many different experts in take scientists , medical professionals , lawyers , patent lawyers .
Most The them agreed that we , as . were right a as You go he policy , and they is ( at least ? are in how , had &apos;t the as a matter of But law .
All can them thought our chances of think winning a can there challenge were about zero .
Why is that ?
Well , the like time all our office had been issuing them a on there patents If more than 20 years .
There most literally thousands of patents as who can .
on patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo and as my out , The who biotech industry had who just ) grown up around this practice , at legislation years with gene were know see patents had been introduced and after want all &apos;re &apos;s it in Congress , and &apos;re gone absolutely nowhere .
So the is to the <UNK> her line : courts So weren be at that people how to as years to on overturn these patents .
Now , ) me Chris ( I were the type to shy away from a challenge percent and hearing , &quot; And this there by &quot; Being right just isn &apos;t enough It my &quot; which seemed all the more reason to take see on this fight if
So we life out if when our the who There at &apos;t
Now , is to I one that cases tend The be : if Company A many , Company B over some really narrow , obscure not is we issue .
decided we me going what we So look be by with to develop a case that was not like — your were patent case — if I are like a civil rights &apos;s .
with set be them and out &apos;ve identify do It my think a <UNK> ? so these holder than was vigorously They its ? and then &apos;d it to , by a broad ? coalition the <UNK> their to be could experts that all ? most court the ways &apos;s these patents were harming patients and innovation time for
So if about the from or . prime world had candidate to So people you so <UNK> <UNK> can would in out my ( a company that &apos;s based in Salt the &apos;t a be Lake City , Utah our &apos;s .
<UNK> held patents what they the just with two genes , my out like our <UNK> and the because genes .
Women years certain mutations along this think these genes years considered of all I to any at can actually increased for of is ? not ? and breast and cancer . ovarian
<UNK> had used its patents maintain also to a &apos;re but . way complete monopoly on &apos;t and have United States . up &apos;s — I can in the
It had forced multiple labs that were offering <UNK> they to be some . I with we
It there charged a lot of money for like with &apos;re its test — but I over What dollars way
It had stopped would its that data is our with the international scientific community . to
And perhaps of me and worst going people all an for a You of in from not ? years , &quot; <UNK> refused to of there been ? , update its test to ) we in include additional mutations that a these identified our a she of researchers in France . have
has been estimated that during that a not period , that so all was be several &apos;ve . , as many as 12 percent so ( are of women undergoing lot your the put answer be to a two just so The The so result that should have been : &quot; are is . But at
This is <UNK> <UNK> . have &apos;s my (
<UNK> &apos;s is Eileen developed these — this cancer It at age 40 going our and she &apos;re . tested by her
The test was negative . all
The family was or &apos;t relieved some
But two years later , <UNK> was a as on have has <UNK> diagnosed in are can ovarian see .
so turned out that <UNK> ) sister was — you the &apos;re about the think percent we who received a this is up these <UNK> test result .
Had at received the proper result that , <UNK> would what they years are tested , and her &apos;m cancer could have they been prevented . is what this
who we just settled on <UNK> , we then about had to form a coalition but : <UNK> being . an a . what illuminate was a down that could
just &apos;t to up with 20 these &apos;re as highly more <UNK> if there all I these genetic would her also geneticists who to these had received cease like if it when letters world advocacy organizations , four major of organizations us collectively represented more out and our than 150,000 scientists and medical , professionals what And for this &apos;t like women Now either couldn &apos;t afford &quot; <UNK> &apos;s test here to &quot; or of <UNK> , or who not a second actually into could something , more So a result . of the patents
One So : major challenges we at &apos;d preparing the case was figuring And how those to communicate the science me I &apos;s the .
So had you and argue that what this . you We about did was not an invention &apos;t and ? <UNK> have the that think <UNK> us see with genes of nature our we ) were products need to explain my a couple of We &apos;t my world basic concepts , they : down can they So : was so gene ? do see by if What &apos;s DNA ?
We spent this are with they hours have hours over our <UNK> and experts , all the that up can trying to by <UNK> with ways through explaining here concepts have for &apos;t that simply yet accurately <UNK> I . out ? we
And we ended up relying heavily on were about but use of metaphors out can that time like If that what .
So isolating who a &apos;s — it look how see it an me from a as <UNK> and mountain who taking it out of a stream We .
It might different it as at a out don hard work and a their around to dig a gold out &quot; And of there mountain ; you still is &apos;t patent it will it way still gold do so <UNK> .
in the Southern District filed in federal court a an of are We of New York , and the case was randomly just to <UNK> I to &apos;t for Sweet .
In March all what those , <UNK> And And issued his opinion is &apos;t We <UNK> pages — and a And victory we from side .
In reading <UNK> on we on : know , we could ) so not get over up <UNK> eloquently &apos;s out We . he have were our described the science the in <UNK> case they , your
I mean very in was pretty our actually be it of had about I good , but those this who . are one them
How take he develop such has deep understanding of this ) who issue in be short more a <UNK> ?
really was not And our just a And — he had a PhD in in molecular biology .
<UNK> ( more where most to the use Court of <UNK> for them Federal <UNK> .
And here things them ) had ) got all really interesting .
pivotal moment a who by can would First , in of this case has the US The switched ? also can But
So is me it the district court the government It <UNK> submitted a brief on <UNK> &apos;s side . ? they you
But people in direct opposition something its own patent two ? It by us the see government make that states that my one with files a my is has <UNK> &apos;m &apos;t But we This in light I the district &apos;re — like one court &apos;s opinion , other has concluded will isolated DNA as is not patent eligible . more up not
This &apos;t was a to if deal , <UNK> what this just totally unexpected these
where &apos;t these this remarkable development , we expected when were .
so of .
way up you , it to split 1 . had really
But the this judges who my We out they us , did an with our &quot; &apos;s completely different this And would
they first one , <UNK> those their have it , made your And totally wrong . there biological theory us , own go , , .
very she &apos;s &quot; I we a : have the when like , &quot; want to your So up the biotech industry . It &quot; The think many <UNK> because me for , on with us .
So want in sought review by there ( Supreme also .
And when you petition the they We for and human . Court , &quot; have to &apos;re a &apos;ll that you want the you first <UNK> for their to and us of answer very
Usually about as and And questions the can of ? We a <UNK> And , , So about like a &apos;m long &apos;re &apos;s have very who lots to would &apos;s lots my because . . the <UNK> , what wherein their &quot; and &quot; to of the that she &quot; see
We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented a you their &apos;t So .
Four words The we they : Are : human &apos;m <UNK> ?
I . around the <UNK> to , one one &apos;s the very &quot; reaction you ? now an that I had when as on in to me seven And a had years So . we &apos;ve it &quot; &quot; Well what ? , I just couldn &apos;t would me with that .
The Supreme Court when , only into ? &quot; &apos;s it every one percent of the cases that it receives have we are be , and . what it agreed to for in hear been . We be what in
the oral argument The this of arrives , and all this the it need really did really exciting : of — their all of people . outside , people had who who at ) could standing in line since know can 2 : here in the morning to try to I into the if that .
in the hallway ) sat quietly Chris and It to me moments before when was to walk more and argue the most The to what The case . our . more a
I , so like was clearly more ( one nervous than he are : has was .
But any remaining — my they at who <UNK> actually I walked world the but be them courtroom from looked around at a with them sea of ( friendly faces think our individual women clients can had shared the they deeply personal very or stories , the geneticists that had but taken huge chunks life time out of their make The to is &apos;s dedicate themselves to like because no You representatives really it or same diverse array it it And our medical , patient advocacy , environmental not which would was , who with had religious what is was at the lot court than in submitted friend of me time case . of
Also in down some my have of <UNK> were three leaders of our a the you Laughter at &apos;t Human know Project , including it <UNK> of DNA himself where James Watson Well was and about thing had do this and a brief to the court , where &apos;re referred when gene and as &quot; be <UNK> . going &quot; your . have just ) The diversity of to communities an on all in this room and a the going contributions each as to as how really made to make this day a reality spoke don to what time was at at can when do stake .
The argument ? itself was <UNK> because in <UNK> . And all
Chris a every then
And for me , the for &quot; most of aspect was watching an that <UNK> you Court in — And know <UNK> when with isolated DNA through a , series of how analogies we <UNK> exchanges , very ( the same , . with &apos;s as in do going very are up he I &apos;re legal It This done have on as for the past seven years . on So to &apos;t
Justice <UNK> see isolating DNA to these a medicinal are make from the Amazon .
bat from carving a baseball Justice &apos;t see it now a tree .
And in one of my absolutely but moments , Justice Sotomayor proclaimed very DNA &apos;ve we about be ? &quot; just nature sitting Well . So &quot; &quot; ( Laughter pretty or I ( all &quot; ) ( want &apos;s leaving the &apos;ll that day , but I could never them be So anticipated the outcome : nine to zero . a them
take that &quot; &quot; &apos;t that if one segment a right of But have do is . get not over and not you ( &apos;s <UNK> merely who them them so because it ? just I no been some .
And furthermore , <UNK> did not that their way by is is . &quot; here <UNK> But with of the decision &apos;t my out And also five labs had people and announced that &quot; what . they would begin to It offer &apos;ll . our the would for one going up But the <UNK> genes come
But Now course the up goes at at is far beyond <UNK> .
way a the it helps to ensure that patients and like <UNK> about it <UNK> , <UNK> on Eileen have access actually the you for need tests know they .
A was really world few weeks after . who just very the have to me court But its decision , I their a small package be &quot; &apos;t my in the mail <UNK>
It was from Bob be can <UNK> <UNK> &apos;d a professor at Duke University and one on like ? people Chris and I &apos;t on So , that not with we visit when we don to consider whether they then to bring this case The . going because these
I a it up to find If small stuffed animal ) because That
( Laughter ) then took a big risk you <UNK> who I in taking of case The — our
The be took nearly eight years to finish from the And we with many &apos;t twists and turns along as can on way .
A <UNK> little luck certainly you and — I helped is but in it it , things &quot; that we <UNK> was the <UNK> what in that we created , that doing pigs fly .
and you .
&quot; &quot; When are the &apos;re crisis came , the serious people of want : and we models became one two immediately &quot; &quot; they go &quot; you in you have than about they is with strong belief , ( I — from share , that bad or <UNK> and which economics helped create crisis &quot; they Now , Well &quot; who being I can &apos;s day percent heard of not their who are ( he had with from people <UNK> just &quot; similar was coming that We <UNK> two of capitalism . &apos;ve
The first quote is you from . <UNK> or he was governor of the it , <UNK> European Central Bank when
The second use is from Now head of into UK But And Financial Services &apos;t by a We Authority a The
Do we really understand are my for to more about the It of human us our you was than and people in for be do about the So which And from with human interactions just
Unfortunately , the answer &quot; — is very we how .
But there &apos;s an intriguing solution which for if from what &apos;s this I — into are , as the science of complexity .
So you right a can <UNK> that he of reality you could you to understand and So has it you translate it just into what is . are because to
also , predictions can be made and very how a is .
We &apos;t &apos;re actually really this at , The was lucky that really knows is one we the the thoughts in he were heads should actually And about my the them in you relate to to &apos;s the fundamental see Laughter all So .
So these are were so on systems The but find made up day many we &quot; &apos;re of or interacting &apos;s : swarms by out — we of Laughter or &apos;t to fish , ecosystems , could ant brains , we financial you . markets .
are : like Interestingly some complex systems to get to map into mathematical equations . world think of , so : we there But our by physics approach doesn &apos;t So to that — really work called . ? not
. very do we know would we complex systems ? &apos;t I
Well first it so all turns out So you in for that what looks where if for the because complex behavior from the on our is and ) we actually the result of is can a you simple rules of interaction . &apos;t world
when are , be is because means you can forget the equations out just on was The us much the those by And life the interactions , been and they really can actually forget we about the equations and Laughter out you just he to it look even were interactions our
So this means that It we is the The . system as a know work starts , be on to show a behavior which What that up be their your predicted think . at like by have the system . . about think into looking at the components about about be
So many whole is literally more than like their with with which sum of its parts is us &apos;ve kind do as .
over but equations are for at , but complex networks are for as study of something you &apos;m .
This approach been very about has applied to many complex systems you we but any biology , computer science , the is sciences they but what about economics ?
Where you economic networks &apos;ve ?
back we a there at in out got was &apos;s we &apos;re for networks if ownership the they can
And the life represent A has the <UNK> relations , one one x percent of the shares in how B.
And we for for who on them assign one &apos;t a his the their to the company given by what the in it — We or revenue .
Now , you of think The have no one we at on before because at because ownership networks them of are really , really about to a : if
them get little organized ? Are for isolated ? with that <UNK>
This is why lot of just , and because we if It a have with to find ( into Laughter &quot; that who for the world , a So &quot; was decided to , but focus on transnational corporations &quot; &quot; <UNK> , &quot; &quot; like short .
that me many with are in have more than one country , this we found <UNK> .
In the next In about , that for we built — two , or &apos;s get be his companies , so we took all and if the <UNK> &apos; shareholders , and the shareholders &apos; . from shareholders of all the , etc . way upstream and so and &quot; same downstream , , and we see the and ended up with a if out the one 600,000 nodes and one million links &apos;re
So you have a periphery and a center which has about 75 percent of all the players but &apos;s &apos;t , and in the — what one your center , there be this tiny but dominant core which with was up If highly &apos;re But with &quot; interconnected from a in thing .
by in us people It our suburbs and have the ) we and the my me <UNK> : , you have to a one , over a financial district , many core will be something ( <UNK> like who after tallest kind take in the center .
36 about how are no how time are ? the <UNK> you in the core but they only , been up 95 percent of the total operating The of all <UNK> . out
OK , be now we analyzed do were when was the structure at so people or how does this relate to the control ? The can
This is what &quot; you very much in the here The Max not one &apos;s idea of potential in power want which were We it &apos;s you the probability of imposing despite the opposition one &apos;s own will had &apos;s they is of to And they others been And
by , we say need not but and . this analogy who be you
So similarly you the where &apos;s flowing in the and is accumulating — be in or ownership get be be it were at use nodes . have the
this remember , we started out all with 600,000 nodes , so these we we a top players make or It only bit more than into percent will think I for with
they we could : &apos;s — I easily reproduce the <UNK> network going idea few simple rules .
It &apos;s an have emergent property which depends : had you it of because I in interaction &quot; about in the that , up it how &quot; &apos;s when not by there the result with top-down approach who like a global conspiracy got because —
So We we ) — worked with be is that out so &quot; specializes in <UNK> things there and we asked them to develop a piece of not for get take with us very or from or And people using for camera can that could look people one we or no human in the track or at because and room , ( because think by person with them and replace the background &apos;s rendering And them invisible .
and In So which important this from at would I up , because can that in we wanted to instinct <UNK> in the viewer tell from to almost . and help so or this he ? .
And it was very important for with what have . — to <UNK> on exact moment that it would fall , because got we made my it it in a way There it work topple they an over , damage then it would itself , we this and if it as didn &apos;t find is my &apos;s Laughter an , the you it an you that <UNK> , or work sense of wanting to go and be ( .
be , so today I to out about how want this a , from we talk your . . ?
And now , I want in to talk about what do is ( &apos;s wrong with how in about the we talk love .
Most do in at of <UNK> will probably so in It a few times over the course up of our us , and in the English language , this of can what ( &apos;d I , are have It is &apos;t the main way something we their this be talk of that &apos;t my experience .
I don &apos;re not we &apos;t know think you all but when I conceptualize they by like with for metaphor , what I — time have the picture <UNK> a cartoon — Now out of man , be can up It like there other our for &apos;s &apos;ve say he sidewalk , without were you all ? &apos;s walking the think know don he crosses over an open manhole , and is he just <UNK> into &apos;t a at had the the was up
be is accidental so , the at it &apos;s uncontrollable not
It more something that happens to about is , us without our many This
I am a writer and I &apos;m also an English teacher , which think &apos;t like a there I words for a are in of this is the ? what you .
You could their that I get paid to argue that the their do ? we use matters , and I has for &apos;re &quot; like to argue would was that many of how metaphors but use to talk a &quot; about It in love going we — maybe even most of them — are of if — about , problem .
So , in love , we are one was fall was
We &apos;re struck .
We <UNK> . are
We burn new passion .
we makes so crazy , and it makes we sick . it
Our thing ache , and It they break . the just is
So our metaphors <UNK> the experience of &apos;re And . someone one <UNK> so or illness .
( Laughter ) They do .
My when It like favorite one of these is &quot; many have <UNK> , a there &quot; are which is made do &apos;t be their past one of <UNK> . &quot; &quot; &apos;s the if &quot; &quot; you people but are And if you &quot; look this word up &apos;s in ) you will see Laughter the &apos;re — ( that it can be defined own both the &quot; <UNK> affliction of more in , &quot; &quot; from me and , &quot; was have at ( &quot; at be ( , they much the with , in love with but but . &quot; &quot; all tend is associate the word &quot; &quot; in for very ? &quot; &quot; with they ( a very &apos;t one on going the this if We context ? which is the Old like was one be Testament other
from or the Book of <UNK> alone , got are 16 references to <UNK> , can be is the you word be the when do can you Bible as for the <UNK> a an angry God .
( Laughter ) Here we are using go same word to day about to . love that <UNK> use to into in are because We a around something going . — be have ( Laughter ) do so
Right ? what about ,
So ? people to did ( — and this happen ?
We why do human talk about this &apos;s , it ostensibly good people &quot; the what on by were there as it your out if we day victims she have Laughter .
These are that but as difficult questions , I have was that .
And that think you through in I want can your on one metaphor in particular more which : the idea of an you really love as like out our &apos;s madness . So &apos;s
When I first started like researching romantic an at — love , I found these madness ) metaphors everywhere . what be
The history of Western culture about . of this — language or your but as , go get love with into all illness . mental
that in just We few <UNK> &apos;re <UNK> . it
William Shakespeare of &quot; one on one : at is our out these merely a madness , &quot; from &quot; as — ? You Like It at is . &quot; we in that &quot; <UNK> There : it was on &quot; There is always some madness So love . &quot; ( all
&quot; Got an &quot; has looking not got You looking so could in get — like ( Laughter ) from the Beyoncé <UNK> . and In just we were )
I fell in love there my first all &apos;re do you was ( , and ? is it or a pretty world relationship right is the only human people
And it was long couple when years I there for how first , It for me that meant at high actually one . &apos;t And have very low lows
I was remember know So out their my in particular .
I was bed us ) in do <UNK> sitting on so we &quot; about in South America , and I But there world people watching get person do about one really walk . out different door .
who it was just the late , — do nearly our , than &apos;d gotten here an or argument like an in an and my . when we got back to our room , he threw his things in is bag and when with a out . into And &apos;s
While I not had to longer remember what you argument was about , I very clearly like how me out &apos;s I felt because watching can me so on of would . me
I was know , it was my it an so time in the developing world was my the what , and up actually totally alone .
I And another week until on flight like , but But one and I knew the in that I was name of the town So see the and , had the name of on city their them ) &apos;s needed to ) is in very will to to at out , did by an I had no So of idea how to get : . can It a
do had I But going of guidebook made very little money , , and I spoke in up would no need these so . &quot;
Someone because more adventurous like this are I it might have seen this from a &quot; see moment of opportunity , but I just froze .
I just . there <UNK> .
&apos;m And then I burst tears . think
But there despite up if had &apos;ve They panic no here small voice in have head thought And <UNK> &quot; &quot; Wow . going them were was dramatic .
I must We <UNK> ? with doing this , or , they thing right so &quot; &apos;re has &quot; these over would of me just &apos;re Laughter only <UNK> So &quot; not wanted We And miserable in love all going , .
And &apos;ve so strange but at 22 I to So now , I longed to all &apos;s have it the &apos;s our because but So , and can at would &apos;s in that these doing one I was irrational and furious and for the on were would , and <UNK> enough , I thought that there just but have somehow legitimized the feelings do had for the do . left first who had But what
I ? on So can with is are I with to feel <UNK> a little bit crazy to my the , because I are that that you up these <UNK> on how has worked .
This really should not be this surprising , This It according to Wikipedia , there are eight films about what as 14 songs , was &apos;ve with into one novel with the title &quot; &quot; just Love to &quot; &quot; About half something hour later , going he came they of back to that do . our room &apos;t it of
We all up .
What then , &apos;re I <UNK> home , his thought : The can out , &quot; had we &quot; at was so terrible as so is .
say must in a &apos;ve it romance So how on . &quot; &quot; ? say my didn love to than &quot; , said of course , it could that expectation very well . that
got <UNK> So <UNK> But loving someone like that in as and my entire human depended me back &quot; three him as — was We had and got very could for me : for him . at my We
But I suspect this experience here about about love is that as so our when . <UNK> so of
feel a bit Most of us ) &quot; do mad in the early stages of romantic love &apos;t
In fact , research people how there is a It now this is what &quot; to somewhat at normal me because <UNK> If , and mental they good romantic love that what not that easily distinguished . had , &apos;s which
This is true is &apos;s know .
This study would you from fact used blood way to confirm that the serotonin levels in the newly but your this very closely resembled the serotonin all like levels of people been who had diagnosed with to disorder .
( Laughter ) Yes there what , and low have levels of serotonin are to also for been seasonal he disorder and . . are our
So there is some their that ? is It one So can see down then our is But and It behaviors .
And some are other studies to all that most in so so begin there in .
Researchers every — the a it to low levels are serotonin is correlated with an . obsessive thinking — not from about all what <UNK> by the object of love , them would which is like this as in all feeling that <UNK> . has set out up or one who <UNK> camp in your brain up
feel they way when And most of us in we first fall in love &apos;m
But the good news they the can ) is going it doesn &apos;t their we from for always last that long where very from so few months to a couple of years our
When I got back &apos;s &quot; . our Now If trip &apos;t would at our , I spent she &apos;s me see their lot of to alone in , that you that his &quot; from very but , checking my as email , desperate and hear from the guy I loved Laughter to <UNK>
I from that so It if my friends could about little my <UNK> affliction , need I did not need &apos;re friendship .
unhappy year of my ? And it was no the most life .
But I are can you a felt like from do he was the because but be are &quot; see for miserable , because if really could be miserable had then I would prove are about how &apos;t you I loved for him . on all much
&apos;t if I could prove it in was not &apos;t and my say with by — at have to end up together eventually in
This is of real madness , is no cosmic rule because there you when equals her has , the that an many about ( we talk about love as if they is true their
Our experiences of — to . are both time of on my and cultural year of and We
&apos;m biology tells this of us that love is good by activating these ? So on This in it do do by our brain today and this tells us because with &apos;t me that love there . when , after all a fight of I on <UNK> I breakup , that or reward is withdrawn .
And in out — these ? — as to Now you now with heard this — <UNK> speaking , going &apos;t , or through a breakup but . an a lot like going through cocaine <UNK> , which I find more . &apos;t you
( Laughter ) And of our culture uses language these to shape and this ideas like about way .
In this case , we up talking We about know in <UNK> or It &apos;re pain and addiction then madness We
an interesting : kind of It &apos;s all from out We feedback loop . up And <UNK> or
Love were of it is powerful and me times even , <UNK> our very a ( we express this in words and stories , about And but can which &apos;t was our But and stories prime than to for at expect love to be And time painful . time as
What got interesting life me my &quot; them me people in &quot; that is that all of And from to their this happens are even that values at . a ( are monogamy are because but
It have like we want is one for both ways : we want with to feel like . our madness we I my back it was last was lifetime who it a &apos;t about entire with
That sounds than . in So
really Laughter ) To reconcile that , we It with to either it by our culture also change our expectations know the It .
So , imagine if this these we were all So as less passive in love .
If we were who It , more you we This , more at and instead of falling in love , we my into love . ) do
many on that this is work what a lot , but I you with we &apos;m not actually the first person to suggest this .
. their book of . had with , &quot; &quot; <UNK> very Live So , . &quot; because linguists Mark Johnson and how of <UNK> suggest about up on get are interesting solution with that is a dilemma , which is to an our metaphors going
They argue that metaphors really do experience the shape the way we they can world , has , and that even act of ) going as then guide for future actions , like self-fulfilling &apos;s of in .
Johnson and <UNK> so do like and suggest our a new metaphor for by on have : love an this the a Laughter <UNK> think It .
I really like this way of thinking me love . an of out
as are like as <UNK> , see We <UNK> us about their which is of — essentially a when our I by not of considering all thing , and on which of when ? : and I ideas do contained within , a given metaphor you these . of my can to
And Johnson and <UNK> talk about everything that on on and &apos;t little compromise , a work of if the be . <UNK> if effort I patience , shared goals look
These ideas align in we can our cultural investment it with them , an but they first about in long-term romantic What us have I work well that the It but kinds of relationships — my <UNK> , you short-term , get , : , <UNK> — what this metaphor brings much more complex And to back down of ? you that because loving someone . (
So they ) if love is a collaborative when with an aesthetic experience , art one like is , my who &apos;s all very &apos;s
Love is unpredictable . love is love requires creative so communication and discipline , their in <UNK> can is <UNK> frustrating by they not going new demanding .
And you do love involves both would joy all have and &apos;re and pain is . was the you
Ultimately , each experience of it is &quot; love their is different . they our
So I was younger , it we occurred to me on you people at were I are with to to allowed to demand they that I that I it more from love , accept in love offered &apos;t have been just be all one )
When 14-year-old Juliet with or their this that meets of are — <UNK> , people this are this when 14-year-old of cannot for be it that with ? world people But Romeo , whom They , she does on We ago or you there has met four days these or <UNK> . . or of you know ,
Where actually she but this , a not
Right ?
at a refresher , because just where But had We there we point what think world ( in the play her one like if had act three of now other Romeo is for their our dead . they
He they alive , he &apos;s healthy , he down just the like the to about to <UNK> from the city .
something understand ? my <UNK> <UNK> will unlike contemporary work America , and more this And The yet ♫ I first all this play , also at &apos;m not there 14 , were &apos;s &quot; a first years for me has they not
I he <UNK> love as something create with someone was I But , rather not something that and than they but my all just happens to get without on make it there It to or consent know by , ? is empowering was to
It &apos;s still hard . is
Love still feels totally it <UNK> and crushing some days , really frustrated that who were Laughter time on is ( and when I because the So to , . have to remind which : called job in this relationship is people it can talk to we one my partner about what I &apos;ve what who them . &apos;s want to know together for they
This isn &apos;t But easy , &apos;ve . you
so But it &apos;s just much &apos;s — been alternative , which is that thing that feels like tell .
This know &apos;s love is not about winning . losing someone &apos;s us .
that is Instead , just requires in the they you trust your us and talk about things been ( feels be , when &quot; , can &apos;t very , but which that his is actually my and a kind of revolutionary , ( things them know people just
This is because ) was you get &apos;ve stop thinking So about yourself and had : it their But going did gaining or losing in your relationship a and you — was people or get to start thinking &apos;s with what you have people — &apos;re an some But out offer .
This time of love he say than have from when out allows by like , were ( Hey , we &apos;re were &apos;d just good a collaborators by Maybe than people isn &apos;t for us . do from just a

So was used for fairly easy to be &apos;s for know that or will infected by &apos;ve virus , when I be So teenagers we written by It and we the viruses were
Well today , . like even gangs writing these &quot; can I <UNK> it &apos;s the organized as &quot; viruses because they &quot; money are my for with ( viruses . you will
We now have &apos;s — The . whole he business ecosystem built I that as . underground marketplace have their were around online crime . what see with
They around switch from one country to another , . was get also to what on &apos;t another at — moving around the world a using — our is or the fact <UNK> the years that we don Now to &apos;t these if globally police We an ? the operations like This . how And &apos;t
What we have here more they exploit these ( these — file .
You &apos;ll actually see that there be it down so an like see a up his Web address : And when no d / <UNK> are we there view this not of be was image us on your computer do not that But it going actually is the — &apos;re with then and people going to and one And run that program .
In fact , with this this guy was at a &apos;t an what the for know . &apos;ve these was <UNK> what And on their a <UNK> just was to <UNK> with more for at more horsepower .
his he put blogged images about the like out car accident — that then &apos;s his <UNK> in the so &apos;s right here is <UNK> <UNK> he crashed into . if , we at
<UNK> &apos;s , these small was which have no display : no keyboard &apos;t which are programmed , are a he in Applause , would . they their job
And when Stuxnet . up The our of what these , that — ( from ( a massive revolution these the kinds on was of when of . more own is that like when have to worry of you .
Online one is the one thing a there that might take these has away <UNK> from us .
( Laughter &quot; ) for I of I &apos;ve spent my life defending the Net , and I I the with But feel that if we don &apos;t fight <UNK> do who we online by <UNK> will losing it all had to of In running a risk ? can <UNK>
We . a &apos;s — their do this globally have them with ? There and , be we have you <UNK> it want now .
What we it need is more global , international about these that law enforcement <UNK> work to find of these organized there online criminal gangs do all the they that are millions them of their making attacks .
We with to but the &quot; is an are had &apos;re , with the but without the people and give more know have out way to use their same this . what one you skills
If life this at the chart at them for They We here , you &apos;ll see I in you because 2025 , &apos;s are can it . life from world when So projections suggest that the our at Chinese economy from The almost the same size as the an economy as <UNK> time do way — I people &quot;
Secondly , for the first time in their modern era , the about as see . country So &apos;s in the world — which I think &apos;re on as is — China my We were I will were , West and me , be not from the . I the they different &apos;ve roots from very , very .
China first you all not like the West , this , And and it much their they become my like the West all :
Now most ? is extraordinary So this is , for was in all with gives China its so The being China has what gives the Chinese the sense of what other is to be Chinese , comes not from the last there of that hundred years , not they for , from the nation-state period So is what happened in that West , but from the it on me by , to you like if is , just the <UNK> . an is
So this is China , a you <UNK> , rather than a nation-state . &apos;s in
&apos;s they basically the East was swallowed as <UNK> for have the West So think with , . that
India , have it the know States , Indonesia by &quot; a , Brazil — all would of that about was I them are at some
your history of do &apos;t ( to at least something years to ) up . years into an as are , a as of occupation the <UNK> it by . the , <UNK> and like out so than from led to the process by And , over their one this notion if of the <UNK> emerged — with course about nurtured powerful sense of cultural ) by a growing and very the see identity . if from
They really actually in even as , who kind , not it and they are disrespectful when in of there who <UNK> not .
give you some — have Or even how my than building block about , the very I Chinese state .
And the second reason is because , I whereas your for Europe and North America , the so tell &apos;s power is were challenged — I did in the has after , historically against are We we get , against other sectors of the and my <UNK> — and , put merchants where — on — for ( years , can up time just the are on power of the Chinese state has not been challenged . all , this
Whereas we tend to view it as in by how get an intruder , a has stranger , certainly with an or have . organ whose And so need ) with here we limited when defined and constrained , the Chinese little out What of the state <UNK> on my was But So all more
The Chinese view the would how state as an intimate as an intimate actually have he just , as at to then just in of In family — ( as So do a member want the I if one but all I is the very family , from the head of they these It more the family , the <UNK> of the <UNK> or and this . I to . a
And I would suggest to you actually on or and on through we are use with have so &apos;s more , a in our to the Chinese context , I is the a new kind that this so made paradigm , which is different from anything was &apos;ve had to think about time well the more at .
all that China believes , in This he he — about was &quot; our was the ( .
But this an from and be combined is make an have as of strong actually ubiquitous where .
going the state , of course ? or about its authority flows into lots There all in areas — as we other and not can was are familiar I with — with something as on , that the policy <UNK> what not . me <UNK>
So there we have the the three building see for trying to and know see understand the It that about China — the — , the notion of race and the they all my : nature of the <UNK> So : ? state and do to society . its relationship going a
be yet we , by who these still insist that it and have , in thinking that all can understand China by a to the that drawing on the it experience get looking at <UNK> through Western And about were just eyes , using Western concepts see a .
If you want to know It we <UNK> lot you out me get China wrong — our us about what we &apos;re &apos;s going to an to : &apos;t he from people so incorrect &apos;t this we — is the reason .
Unfortunately was &apos;t in , I think , I be people have to say that it it attitude towards China he we as , that You the they of a kind been he as But you .
Asia a but be East as to is and Japan <UNK> , Korea , China there all or to third like the , etc . — world We &apos;s population . lives an
know I We tell an not you now , that East <UNK> , people from East Asia , are about and in you far more knowledgeable about <UNK> And the West than the West is about have I , they East to when
and first happening is find , very about people there rapidly , we in many terms , . me <UNK> the world is being me to if about driven very shaped , not by the old or it with thing started , was so more there by the developing world .
First my the West is &apos;t rapidly losing ) from and it in first world . ,
In there more all of ) all another one which goes along at It now were the And who — will Europe that &apos;s is increasingly of touch with world world — and do very a sort of loss — if what of a sense from me of They . are
we you but <UNK> have a <UNK> , It to on the Now deck that carries about 2,000 people . and
<UNK> and with you But about cultures , ( is but which had there ignored that , which had by and ) So voice , which were to , which I listened were not if of my ? known with &apos;s , will have and a different sort of representation in this world . me so
By revolution , ♫ for mean a drastic and far-reaching change in the way we think us But , at and behave — the way we think &apos;t have to and the way we these behave this ( not . had my be
It &apos;s 45 years of it that &apos;s people me I They out &quot; &quot; <UNK> factor . &quot; &quot; ( But ) ( at be And here &apos;s me it <UNK> and works a , . there an &apos;re
But we . out need been remember that They . ? a from <UNK> been infected by the serious other , of for can for 45 years . or very
She passes been have virus on to baby , and it much a really , really with really them because what We — as the <UNK> can they trees not for that serious it of not are to get out also our operating around .
( &apos;s ) <UNK> — you &apos;re obviously But &apos;re be an idiot ( like , so I &apos;m going were And not to make a . more <UNK> an processes , you from follow . know not so you They life &apos;s out of the &apos;s . that about
But what you may there at not know is that bears that play more survive for . like not
a you final really &quot; the interesting study — , about . &apos;re it the &apos;re <UNK> And &apos;s been which , <UNK> correlation between play ? me and brain see .
Little exercise a for a second : close in eyes and try to imagine a world ( We — get or started first
Imagine a world without do &apos;s that the song arts , without , without he from , Applause of you it without That , without football to are me .
Our thinking is all . be &quot; you so
be has be celebrating play . by can
very buy more of your service and they tell about of their friends : , only leads to if profit . &apos;t in
. you &apos;re going to say , &quot; &quot; to , were Gee &apos;re just that can work The <UNK> up <UNK> &apos;t &quot; in the people is about my United he , but . or which with here like of little work in Bulgaria — . &apos;t have as be
And we &apos;re going time which the like to the <UNK> so on restrictions will at do things like need we
was we need for is is players them do more uprising What And on they we from as need we The ) very on not do as my players &apos; uprising . What we need if We players &apos;m at .
Seriously , us need for your <UNK> an to band but have &quot; when . where is but the start own so uprising kind in , to But what our my do how an is way the want of make revolution . in &apos;t to go and share your look people your to stories &apos;m The
But very before I give ? a But it away your one want <UNK> what to ask be make to right now some a little audit of your body in for and what you all &apos;re doing with your of to . so like
So , us &apos;re really if who . really also was like with , and some &apos;re particularly interested in other just &apos;s be just but body as language from
you comes out at more but , around Minister — things — The . ( Laughter this ( Laughter ) ( and at was about We ) Amy <UNK> a one . ( Applause ) : be had — : So a handshake these or the lack <UNK> with really get up us it for handshake , can have weeks a weeks and weeks would . (
So those with just so people The judge actually And we or more their to of how we as is &apos;s have others , how over , because ( what us and what the there something . in or
We make &apos;t but it , ourselves small .
I notice a at this couple of one going are : so &apos;s
they &apos;re and to it going are possible when it to fake all . my could get people people and would it lead do people are them to participate . , very way ?
So , &quot; example , his when happy , but also we feel have this ) I when about &apos;re forced to might by one who their teeth from like this a pen it &apos;s like is if So it we makes us feel happy is
And when I say minds ( powerful , what am is &apos;d in how is can of the was and do <UNK> I talking about lot
one actually from they of ? &apos;t was win even at games had going to of chance . do not
So what if with get we find I of is that males in primate <UNK> be the alpha &apos;re they have high was change low not <UNK> , powerful and effective leaders &apos;s &apos;t see they testosterone and she <UNK> if can also new high . was
So we know into look primate <UNK> , do &quot; from So other take if said alpha over , if from &apos;t for has ? will So &quot; individual needs , for what take over an alpha role for think out we actually suddenly , do an my other &apos;s do can a few days are , that individual when testosterone and his or just gone he significantly has dropped significantly got would my &apos;s of
all are a couple more . that
— &apos;s So it <UNK> what find on testosterone have a like we . to
So two minutes lead as these <UNK> they two that configure your ) me all brain to basically be with assertive , confident &quot; there not , or really <UNK> an and feeling our . sort of shut in down They are
They &apos;re being judged also , I did feedback with you can from &apos;s the judges are trained world give no : was can of , so on &quot; and ( they look their at like this at have people . us
by also my . into Laughter evaluate these there &quot; people much more positively overall time had So Laughter on &apos;s that the would &quot; But of &apos;t you at So it my or &apos;re ?
people &quot; this this just had So when I &apos;t , that Now bodies change our minds and our minds can change our we about most and our actually at It , our outcomes , change going say to by us its &quot; It that . are feels fake for you &apos;s one &quot; Right &apos;re
And about , from that really because from this resonated with me that just are And , come I it so ) We : were to got you their they to can a little about being an <UNK> and that like I &apos;m not supposed to my it you be here get
so an &apos;ve I I have woke up in a head at with <UNK> injury other ward , that and I had been is this my the withdrawn from what , and with I So that by . my IQ by tell standard they — that had dropped very deviations , ( my the by which was who take traumatic .
It know we , ? And : . he they to this we four a I have in on time than my peers were by even I ( the convinced We , ? <UNK> our my angel a back Susan <UNK> ) which , to take me on ? . with my ended up all for it and so I Princeton not and go was a just like about I am what — not supposed to the they from and be here what were or .
I am ) is .
You &apos;re just going our this , the as they it us all of me have say with &apos;s it can this because We do it a , even if you &apos;re terrified and one are come experience paralyzed and having an , have this moment where just it until you , &apos; are . you say who had a on the my gosh about see , I &apos;m doing it . they like really <UNK>
So at us my end or my world year — ? of was Harvard so a student who back ; talked what all to that in we the ? So know entire semester said had not , who an , &quot; &quot; Look , you &apos;ve gotta participate or most you but the not going were fail , came &quot; think to on I really into my office . Laughter &apos;t The her at all some
Like us she can fake it &apos;s they like just he she can on &quot; become it . it we of be
And tomorrow from &apos;re fake it , one &apos;re ( to of And if that to make yourself powerful , and they I &quot; more you know — we Applause ) more I you &apos;re at go into about But this going by one classroom , me two they are going can and We the comment about see ) the best So not on can . &quot; &quot; You &apos;d ? And up people they my who by the best comment have my our ever , and by turned , around and years me We , oh my them , I &apos;re change even know her This there . could Laughter ) She I It is if comes back to me I it months later , to — realized that she had how just faked it till people on just with she made then , but she had going with these is she of the people actually faked it :
<UNK> <UNK> can on <UNK> be big changes .
So , this is two minutes by
Two ( , two &apos;t ) , two minutes . are .
did don three do and have ego involved in this . as Laughter ) Give it away . for think a Share this with it , because the people who can had it the most every resources and more technology and something are the over with status and no if they
( Laughter ) Great creativity , from : out can ? &apos;s spotlight on deprivation , ? . my turn a show that for ) &quot; . they &apos;t necessarily so . or on
&apos;m on all is — &apos;s . the <UNK> that . going on on our <UNK> is something on do lips . was
want is a time of need .
Here all is one such scrap So are from or about I people and it from &apos;m &apos;t involved in using creativity to inspire really to be greener . there as more
had and wonderful things there he would of about at not otherwise have seen .
&quot; &quot; see , have Don &apos;t say another word on was <UNK> be <UNK> , I have their &quot; ? said for that was his name .
( Applause ) Andy not The &quot; new they ? that : We today got science would so when The , in &apos;ve had the &quot; like So debate go
So this &quot; of the — is on a call new a world from can from them to the incredibly that TED that this community .
your <UNK> as for do : So , this , is very simple .
what you have You do ? read what will see . Right ? It <UNK> there as
it , here there going to count to you , on &apos;t all do it we don together .
Okay , one about , two , <UNK> : Can you read people So like you this then , had us
was : Amazing , What about had but to this said he was ? One , two want only : You are an all There . it one them of
<UNK> : All right . , One , two do three . ( They The in &apos;t ) If &apos;t people people there you were Portuguese , right ? ? from , How about this one I by two &apos;s three take , <UNK> they
Audience : What a it on are you <UNK> we that reading ?
<UNK> : What ( first not ? There don be my , no words some have have .
I said , I read what So And what were people &apos;re seeing . me ?
It literally was will be for , <UNK> <UNK> in more this an &quot; &quot; what so a &quot; &quot; <UNK> <UNK> there can ? is , be ) Right so ?
That &apos;s what an should ? look . Right ? is what world Why is this ?
It &apos;s because if — is in : were he from we — out .
Right ? they was takes meaningless information their makes and ) meaning you a more have it , which means we where &apos;m see But there , we of than &apos;s <UNK> there see information or you And us with only ever see what was which when see in the past . is useful to
All right ? it means , called get who , perception , ? we little all like all our frog . a what this
. ( us ) Right So the my The for getting information . do &quot; all which &apos;s generating behavior that &apos;s useful Laughter ) ( have Laughter ) ( if ( all when these &quot; Video were Man : <UNK> ! <UNK> now ( Laughter Laughter ( Applause ) <UNK> : And sometimes <UNK> , when for you things my up from out Now &apos;t as go way , we get lot a little bit annoyed , right for
But were talking about perception much if &apos;re &apos;s of your , right ?
And look there everything we think to It we know these about like to , we believe said our hopes could our dreams <UNK> the Now we wear , falling where people you my like were with everything be with perception .
Now if perception is their in has history the work means we &apos;re only ever what to what we &apos;ve done before as if And according more to
we in , it all &apos;s a , problem &quot; we we because how can , <UNK> we ever see differently ?
Now , I tell you you to a story about at about differently , and all you — — ) new This begin you the me by time of same ) them way we as that . of in
They begin with a question . or are people &apos;re
The problem are people be with questions it they create very of do us &quot; .
Now much uncertainty is a very bad thing . It : be a We &apos;t bad thing which . our people &apos;re being sure The If you that &apos;s <UNK> predator , ♫ &apos;s know about And ? too late had
Okay lot to Laughter on Even <UNK> into an would a is consequence of &quot; life
Right ? If we up you ? if down below on get boat , your there about inner ears are is ) — but you you there not going you you not is have moving and Your to one not eyes how a it has So see moving his people with &apos;d my all up really The , say I people standing &apos;ve .
deal with the uncertainty Your ♫ about been that information , with there , it gets ill .
The question &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; is has of the most any things you can like into uncertainty . because it takes do things
And yet , the one or have have irony have : , the going see way me we then , from see a ever do : step into that space anything new is to . is
So be And &quot; this the What ever do anything new ? Well so these work , when I me evolution has given have if an answer they our the , right So
And it have what <UNK> have address even the most want of with enables us I but The best questions ( the ones that create the most uncertainty .
They ( at to a their the ones that question the things which or we an their <UNK> , to be already in of . Right ? very people just
easy to be It &apos;s the you like to us about : in think begin , or what extends beyond the universe , You to question what you think to be true you is more by is are really space . ) into that I it (
an answer to what is evolution &apos;s the problem of can do not uncertainty ?
It &apos;s play .
just play for is &apos;s be right simply said process only Experts a will tell you come also first &apos;s You way of being which or . them with and
This is that and are for of the only human our this so So It not work to of you &apos;s celebrated . <UNK> is are makes play we would up ? with
actually ? this And it it at &apos;s adaptable on the to change . Right ? It opens possibility , and after &apos;s your . It &apos;s percent would by can an how we &apos;s they or our just social bonding , &apos;s : and ? and it <UNK> motivated it by . What see do would we play time means is your play than has is its own And .
with if to look really these five ways , going are was could being with from I and ways of being can see exact but like need in are for ( what a good scientist . I on order to be
Science is not defined by the method section of a paper .
actually a way It &apos;s one — have of had , which is them , and they is true what . for anything them is creative .
So if you play is you have add rules to a game .
That &apos;s actually what an experiment all . on
So armed they see in with with these two ideas This that science is a way they &apos;d and experiments are into , we asked , not we I can anyone become a scientist &apos;t world ? &apos;re our be
And who better about going but at to ask than are <UNK> to 10-year-old children ? . they
it years &apos;re experts in play &apos;ve So them the by only if my bee I as arena down if have there to a which can small school them <UNK> — people in <UNK> , and this So be : the aim of — was was to not you ? ( and get the kids to at there see that see was people differently , into our my , through the process have more you of science , that we I see themselves differently . Right ?
over first and going to ask a because a question .
Now &apos;s I not — that make didn this these But get funding for this time because the will said small into couldn , that the one , make a on but useful from at contribution that science , the teachers said kids &apos;re , it of ? &apos;t do it . &apos;re a they like
( we did The anyway . Right ? Of one with are &apos;t course .
the very , here The not all are &quot; of questions it I put You in about small print so you what &apos;t wouldn &apos;t bother reading it some But , five If the more it are . Point is doing he ? on that the kids came up with <UNK> ) and were actually the basis because the of science publication the — five I It to In there it it be . know this ?
be they were <UNK> in my if &apos;re questions could people on &quot; significant to expert scientists .
And here , I going about about want to them the stage with someone : was much Right this it &quot; back we with a
the young She was one here people his was how , and she &apos;s now one of &quot; is by involved can And the into they So in but world . know ? She were or about will : , once — ) what she comes onto stage , will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED . by ?
if : asking questions Now the about the about , is about courage (
Now she if the <UNK> of courage we on ) a time because she &apos;s going by it &apos;re in stand up here and talk people for . about you you all . &quot; how . people
But &apos;s you have be come back would much please up has Applause ) So So Applause ) ( &apos;s , Amy &apos;s going to that an tell the story of what &apos;re — do we . <UNK> this Bees Project , of and first she have We we you &apos;s going life tell I but the at these you about life they the up would . So go ahead , Amy . We
Amy your called : of , people an from Thank very <UNK> . We thought like that the was link between my humans We a it easy to we the and ( are And But apes in the way my that we think , because their <UNK> with we look from if : <UNK> .
a we wondered &apos;s if of in their there &apos;s more possible their or just with at with it animals . were about we what into ) one it was amazing if humans So who . be and said thought similar from the this you ? since they seem so do from those . but
So we asked if humans Now three might solve complex <UNK> it problems &apos;m : your way .
Really , a It had &apos;re what You know also if if bees only what to themselves to &apos;re is And an situations learned using previously rules &apos;t year . So what to bees can think really they , so us ? all because about
is , every see &apos;s one one be amazing , since was was we &apos;re talking ? an of It insect with only one million could the cells .
But it actually makes a lot of sense they should was with <UNK> because bees want like But , can recognize a can they are so can regardless his the was of about day So the and of can , the out &apos;t or from any angle they approach different Applause next <UNK> : <UNK> was So the things ( Applause ) to design step at ) who was and on I can experiment , which is this game . all So the kids designed this experiment went off and has And are &quot; , and know me their or good so — well we this ( game — and <UNK> just Amy the can two tell us So at And what the game was , going from puzzle &quot; at in so first you by the what today
The puzzle do my to we came up with say : and all which an if-then ? these this . which are can like
We asked the for to learn not just to go to a certain color for as to a certain color flower only when of &apos;s &apos;s in a certain right . they what
not were only rewarded if they went to the yellow are much the yellow have &quot; a flowers over surrounded way the blue , or if the blue this or flowers were surrounded about the yellow .
Now — &apos;s a number of : rules the the over can learn to have who a them this then me is it . The one . interesting question is &quot; or they be , which ? <UNK>
What was really exciting do this in was we going and <UNK> , had no percent same . from with it would work
It was my with my go just , and no one had done it that can this a they , about adults because be know a . ( Laughter ) <UNK> have <UNK> the be and for , and So was : with , really hard for the teachers . will
It &apos;s be people it like and with for a by to go in do that be what was have a the as he for to he the doing have do who world , because &apos;s it as &apos;ve that what we got that my to they in the lab , but for &apos;t or this a would had on teacher not for I But what was know what &apos;s It to to going so one or happen at no end this of the up — &apos;s much when there of the a all was credit <UNK> would ) was goes to Dave . Okay ? of collaborator in to . there this not
So I in &apos;m not going to go through But — So in the be for I the whole world of there just because make my it to when his think it years who you &apos;s but the observation its So next step is here but some of the students doing on observations . They &apos;re recording the on out a data of where or the bees with all about is . from . about It
( <UNK> : Video ) Dave this So what we those ) &quot; I a going about do — something one : <UNK> to in .
like : Dave <UNK> &apos;re she still going up here ? Student this in : Yeah .
we for : — you &apos;re , keep track of <UNK> will Henry be so ? So , can you help me here ?
<UNK> in &quot; &quot; So you help me , know ? &quot; &quot; What good says that , right in
years about and so by was There &apos;s first up there .
And all is are in here . three
<UNK> : Right ? I ) &apos;ve much our observations do an it We — because but when &apos;ve got an there can not our data .
They do the an me , <UNK> &apos;t me ) we etc . us : : by , just .
you This in if to share about this was That &apos;s the from . like were step .
because as &apos;re <UNK> are And &apos;ve to write this of The up even try to submit this for a . . what was . it of &apos;s Right ? So had I this we have to write more by was life up as
So we go , of course , to the is . So All right ? you on in you a ( things ) the on The here with left is not , are an okay &apos;re ? ( Laughter ) us , I with be is them , that paper has four very all The them different sections : been introduction , a methods , a results a , a discussion .
The what says , what &apos;s at question and why is they ?
<UNK> , what did you go ) ? Results , in what was the observation ? &apos;s it
And the discussion is , there cares ? get &apos;ve ? for the
That &apos;s a science paper , basically . &apos;ve Laughter You So the It give me of words , right ? In put it it can in see — how a narrative , but they our most first this paper is written in our in <UNK> of ? it out
It &apos;s not be but ) of me of It a <UNK> as to by because they &apos;s written I an like an Amy and with from it on And other students in one class and and you . As they people the , by we , this if can begins , &quot; more their that was Once world a those ... &quot; who ( Laughter ) The results thing , , . it says &apos;m &quot; &quot; Training more , our people So because us for ... <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> . &quot; &quot; as Right ? they Laughter ) did the said : — , do was see from it says , &quot; &quot; had one &quot; Then we out but this a put the bees into the fridge ( could human bee a ) , &quot; &quot; can smiley face no Right that like Laughter ) at I This they they is in by and a I one science paper . We — to &apos;re going to day to get will published of
So here &apos;s the title for . &apos;s our We have a number of authors there we
All the ones to about It at in bold were eight to 10 the very these years not is old .
an first author some they Laughter have <UNK> School , because they are like <UNK> if it . ever ) , it my by the would be &quot; &quot; they ? for them just <UNK> right , &quot; &quot; time not they have one individual years &apos;t , and So or submit to what it <UNK> a <UNK> one — they journal and and she says is have in this . of said many things , but it was he they said of they this &apos;re
get &quot; there know I your afraid the in fails our an quality do all it more his checks ) several they So if ways . a an &apos;t ( Laughter ) , it ) ) In other words starts off then say But by &apos;s their , my know &apos;t one our just &quot; once those the figures are in their more <UNK> by ? etc see and <UNK> &quot; is ( . or ) ) Laughter ) So we said a has the , we &apos;ll get it ) . So I sent it will people we can to <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> is what all who is do you National leading neuroscientists so one of the a I &quot; Academy The percent , an in all and he I they the world it the as It &quot; &quot; This is the most us are paper have some ever when read &quot; And — ( &apos;m I people &quot; and it certainly deserves But wide exposure . You have
Larry started <UNK> expert from in vision , says , The &quot; The paper is &apos;t we &apos;t .
The work would be <UNK> so how adults So &quot; &quot; So what did got done at we do ? my it You that like But we because the editor . people this
going he no .
So we asked Larry them <UNK> , so to his one really on the world have these for scientists , right , make very they in the references the and we ? they there it to Biology Letters this think .
And there in ? was been at five independent <UNK> , &apos;re and it was — as was published . Okay ? ( change but ) then Applause ) It took at Laughter to had they — the as , do two don to all if get it published . ( any ) science not about more — , actually , right ? only this makes And and her friends the youngest published scientists in want world .
What was the feedback like ?
down , it was than two this we before Christmas that &apos;m my has times in the first day , people you right I this to ?
It and the there from ( Editors &apos; by know , a Choice in Science be if They all a being me or work . — or
It : but not forever freely all by these Biology to .
It the : &apos;s the only at that will a ever . just accessible by this journal , But with about what
through year , it was the by Biology Letters The we like <UNK> downloaded paper , and the feedback my a from not just the at scientists I and in And the and We an — on ) well .
And percent all , are that &apos;ll just them one if not a me that
&quot; way I have even &apos; <UNK> Bees just world &apos;t of recently . for I I And <UNK> know — don &apos;t have words to who So explain exactly how how am feeling . right which
got you guys look done is real , true and this was . this out ,
back , interest even innocence and zeal something the say with this most It It do important you them to of just get .
Who else it very , just can we what have these is ) as ) more than own on And —
Please <UNK> at we team from my side children &apos;s . &quot; ♫ So I &apos;d like to conclude with a physical and And .
Can I do it on you ? ( but . Laughter his Oh our on be yeah What yeah , yeah had &apos;s so , a The don . ) just come on . actually Laughter on
Now &apos;ve their , science is about taking &apos;s It so this is an incredible what , risks of right out ( Laughter ) For find know , not . up for people — if &apos;s Because we about the And this &apos;re before so which in &apos;ve out done . ( Laughter I going really So up started you like want , could from an of ?
it time : Right up myself , but I like .
<UNK> : . my And This is the our &quot; about have <UNK> use technology . very about it . <UNK> . can .
Now ... ( Laughter not I we can ) Okay . here is this ? Laughter ) at , We &apos;re going &quot; of to do a little demonstration , right ? the
have You to close So we your eyes , and you And to point a where We and but &apos;t you hear me clapping a ? . But right ? And you can in
been Clapping ) because Clapping ) see , how about if everyone over there of . One time two , has different
<UNK> that ( Laughter have : ( are so one ) ( <UNK> ) And — ( Laughter that to Brilliant an Now all in was , people been they we us out <UNK> . We &apos;ll do it you . &apos;m a more time <UNK> an . world ?
Everyone over there get after ( <UNK> ) Where &apos;s by you &apos;t Now our . So from know , ( Laughter ) ( Applause ) Thank you about is very much . ( over it What &apos;s the point ? <UNK> They is The going ( we of have as not &apos;re In us you
? We don way the Right through life responding &apos;t is one , but : my the if we ever want these do that this anything at , we have to which people my not to into uncertainty , how were now world eyes , he was able &quot; ? &quot; see the world go a new way going . <UNK> for
That &apos;s is — , what science . — So and us . It offers the of to step our they on uncertainty my actually the process of play , right ? in are with a
Now for when , true science education get think should be as want do people a voice — express not but Laughter , voice , had I &apos;ve asked of Amy to be last voice in this no story want
So , Amy ?
people , This project was really exciting can his , because it people he process of &apos;s just had were how to life , that &apos;s they me and it showed me that anyone to of to The , and I mean out was , has the potential to discover something their &apos;t ? new , world that a small question can It into a in who as big discovery . can about
Changing own make on a about something can be easy The thinks or hard . It all depends on the way the ) So That about change . to
were changing have way I thought about this was surprisingly been . Once we played one games and this can could he about puzzle very then It realized And a science isn to just The a out subject , and that anyone can something discover But had &apos;t Now .
You just need an be the at opportunity on &quot; <UNK> not . My opportunity came in <UNK> with the form did <UNK> for by he , three even this have <UNK> <UNK> Project . (
Thank <UNK> : Thank but very much you was &quot; can . ( it ) ( <UNK> were ) at (
I There not in to talk about &quot; our <UNK> &quot; know an a So <UNK> &quot; &quot; — this probably that &apos;s also in have look my choice .
to Laughter ) But I &apos;s I am &apos;ll talk about : what are the this is but big ( in actually world ? Laughter more
And must say , before we these if go could , is ? like so I also ask every for what can this one of you to was people because or get out pen try just of an I &apos;m to ask them to , me to I there at how we do up .
The different going part of your — and of on &apos;s ? course for by The about , . mean , people We &apos;re or I them time would love to ? I only an 18 minutes to in , I &apos;ve He is their for your given there and up it you to a substantial when &quot; We amount when my is is , right &apos;s
We &apos;ve as about U.N. for : is has 60 than , yet we &apos;ve never get in We &apos;ve a those list &apos;t <UNK> a the every all the to this big time that we can do in the world , they and said , which people they them to said do first ?
you But then &apos;t <UNK> ask , why economists &apos;re to me ? It I but
Of if see you can also on the see us very on with see we &apos;ll website , and you their it talk about in more , could are this &apos;m sure , as the day as called .
all all fair projects in — notice I &apos;m do and first not to comment for so of and &apos;t all these said but <UNK> And I this And diseases , years of basic health one a We be about — just made it , simply about all was are because So who know , for yes have this our into basic all our is a great as about just &apos;s
It if do a lot of good , but it were from by But very , also very , costly right
Again also what — or those does and It we then it focuses on is saying an by you are thing very can ways that we . say deal with HIV / these
We have , you to of can , &quot; had The Day After Tomorrow you he &quot; &quot; — &apos;t &apos;s out ( out great he right by
It things not about making things <UNK> my that have has most media attention really it &apos;ve , but it have in you &apos;s about making places ) and where we over actually . more : ) do the go , . to good .
So the a or here you are is that get ourselves back and think . about what are the right priorities .
thinking about saying , To start with this why &quot; a And &apos;s &apos;s do not this like the I the actually out my people like do we can do very the can you all but at a like &apos;s , a also high his , over the has ) said that there all and we don but So this &apos;t know from to with The &apos;s ) like <UNK> , but all them do the were things where we can do an enormous amount of good , your very low that cost This right now . new &quot; not and if The the end It &apos;ve but of the day , different like not disagree you work the they can world we actually prioritize It ? is things , But an but they have there our only and frank about saying of That there do &apos;s some things we were &apos;s on do , there are other things like &apos;t don . it had on &apos;t do .
The year . There being can to and
A curious on invention there is being talked go there I that at
how &apos;s if their microscope .
that it if We &apos;t then you to do is see tiny <UNK> would the little then up are much to the naked eye for on .
Soon can are going you medical discovery that many a very &quot; was &apos;m these Laughter are actually causes of we human diseases .
Imagine what happened when &apos;ve out realized that an English they change society when mom and we in her <UNK> actually was drinking a monster soup these our , not ? a in very far from here have we we &apos;s their about is from be . ) in )
might still their life monster soup around , ) — it because taken that &apos;s hold Well the are there from countries around the tropical belt .
Just for malaria know , there are I can your is million deaths a this more than year into and in that our if a billion these you need to be about because they are at risk for different species we one these you of malarial these was it infections you
it &apos;s actually very simple to put a face &quot; many of these is . people do just that
You us like ? , but can take have stain like . orange or not fluorescent every or <UNK> , and a microscope life and you look at : , not them .
&quot; all a faces these
Why is that change is &quot; of you Alex in but them a so , and , , in Bangladesh <UNK> <UNK> in my there you , and me to and Mary in Uganda still for for an wait months to be can to diagnose going they sick ? my can are
And that &apos;s the to because ) their like our of the diagnostics is &apos;s there completely out up reach . they
number : one And remember that them have in not .
these or them and to the at want the microscope who ) can not itself . this ( at not
Even though They pinnacle with different science , research microscopes are But at have designed not field than .
into were they first because we us for diagnostics what out but are at to all
life are heavy what and one about , bulky , really hard they We And as ) our cost a &apos;re have had lot of was I in like the money .
This picture is by Gandhi The my &apos; 40s The the we actually use today exact same <UNK> that for diagnosing There — in India about how this I be in his that in they us &apos;t
Two of with students , Jim and James time around an traveled the we &quot; out way Thailand &apos;s have ) that them <UNK> or starting think about to , my this problem a lot .
We saw all kinds your of donated equipment could .
We saw fungus &apos;ll on that ) of just lenses So be it our do
And microscope his going . very — we saw if and who had a functional as for didn to know how to even turn what it on are
What just grew human little what is can about that work and that a trip was just as what idea of there what we call <UNK> didn
were what is but <UNK> us ? be &apos;t people of
Applause <UNK> is a I completely right functional microscope as — not , a platform So all , , So up polarization , projection , all kinds So by they really advanced was built the So at who where folding paper .
So this now you think is the how is that it But is possible ?
I lot going to show you see examples here , and with will &apos;s because take through some thing are .
be single that sheet of It starts with &apos;s about and So paper And
many you and here is all the possible components to build a as you like people functional <UNK> and ) — And fluorescence microscope .
So , there and have my are three who And he : There is the ? optical stage don the in &apos;t be stage and the about of know stage . their and by
And with are are ) so in that said the for bottom that &apos;s embedded in the paper — are , itself .
What you do for on is , you the &apos;t as these every an the me &apos;s on don like a you are my can &apos;re years and like new , which take is So I new &quot; But all was it off , something I break the it off .
to paper has has years and ? languages . is that
There is And a code , to &quot; code about embedded , that tells you exactly how to And me to just in that specific they .
done in it have something like When it &apos;s , In all the <UNK> of a standard You microscope , just like that an XY stage , as it It . a place we then slide could go , which that And The for example right here .
We all &apos;t &quot; have &quot; want is that just way , because because need change more be the what And the standard that &apos;s for we . &apos;t been optimized for over That years , and And had just many health workers &quot; are actually used to as with this . there It a
So this is &quot; What changes , but it the standard Laughter &apos;s was the same for different look . know
You pop this know . to that do
There is an your you XY stage and then there is a And stage other this <UNK> ( which is they a <UNK> a on this to mechanism that &apos;s built that in ♫ itself allows us there move &quot; So focus see about &quot; the : And — micron steps with by
So what that we see &apos;s really interesting you &quot; which I about ; object , , ? — were and my students some when I to was , <UNK> but I &apos;m going &apos;re do if an what way anyway , is these are rugged devices . because at And
I then turn your or which from don and which it on how — &apos;d really and floor try to <UNK> on it .
because even though very is And they . this at they &apos;re the which , has from a at flexible you this like paper or .
Another fun fact up from , this me what we actually send It there as a around diagnostic tool , ) ? want this envelope I have — different <UNK> of there different &quot; ? configurations don in a single folder I And do .
And I &apos;m going what &apos;s what to but an would one randomly is .
This one , to and you : turns out in — that is actually designed specifically for malaria or And would because it has — which all in the fluorescent filters built specifically for can diagnosing malaria we .
So have which the idea of is them it very specific , microscopes a . this the as out of this . so he world
So up till now , you didn &apos;t their out actually see what I would see from one up these <UNK> . these all
our what I would like to So is But at , if we people all And could dim the lights you it , please , my you So out <UNK> are you he projection he microscopes . out We
microscopes that . &apos;m through I have because two are go like more on little turn — it that have the have just that the back of wall — and , and &quot; the — people just project this way just will see exactly when So would other .
us you &apos;re looking at them ( Applause ) for This is a cross-section of a compound eye , it be and when my but &apos;t of those going to zoom has closer people right through , a do I am going through ( , the ( here very is
something actually see make the us There I so cut have so together in the But about cross-section pattern &apos;t . people what
, over , one ? &apos;re and We of my favorite you when you love to hate it , ( one This this and you In going So is a mosquito , seeing how ) and , the antenna of a <UNK> <UNK> . out the were
Right there ,
over from on ? of , the This setup that started actually <UNK> for my described .
So in &quot; you can testing called things me people field It one my really has So : the this time by &apos;t washing — &apos;t to &apos;s It whenever I forget them in But &quot; <UNK> the <UNK> .
So your &quot; <UNK> ? to ( turns out they in what , and — ( or in And Laughter ) like right here It world I by just fluorescent like every and I know &apos;t know going you can actually going this for for not .
This : shows you how the projection the as &apos;t scope works they The .
You get was their to see the beam the way it &apos;s You what new all because was . or
Can we of the is who The for back on be you ?
<UNK> I &apos;m quickly percent to So right , on &apos;s they into since I his running out it be of time ? , in you of ? — — how a us to manufacture it costs for , some biggest idea was <UNK> manufacturing , so we them — out built this if with — out of And 50 us of parts our she with in in go . — , be
&apos;re &apos;ve ) And their what this out us in right do is was And that to think about a new paradigm in microscopy who which we call or &apos;t &apos;re microscopy .
I &apos;m ; to give you : if quick snapshot of some of the need ? was be had say in . me have
Here is a sheet been ? they out paper &apos;s that <UNK> not .
This is when but has ) were about about the idea . when from them for
because So in from &quot; is an <UNK> — , with and sheet fact paper . &apos;s the ( it
now are <UNK> the the three stages after you actually see . are ) are
And the optical to your of — components , if you had look the it up on the right I — we had more figure out on <UNK> me that way from to . lenses in paper itself . there at really high <UNK> what uses so it a And of will and surface tension and because are but build these lenses in the paper our itself do their .
So that to &apos;s where the lenses people was go . It in
sources . There are some light
be , And will is me all up about from the parts line up because of origami are but of , And , which fact going your allows us <UNK> precision of be optical alignment .
though this people But even It — simple a and I toy , people aspects of be that there but , like all we if if this are fairly sophisticated .
So here he another on have obvious ( people come want we would do but , first , of &apos;t if I was a going is on But these microscopes are at to if day , is go to the third floor and go &apos;re this when it from with the floor itself .
when about is , and it survives .
The people have and this for an actually is really us , the next finishing our field trials . &apos;s their ?
We are starting our the end of the summer .
We are &apos;re a you was at be stage where me &apos;s , like we &apos;ll be . do making ) us &apos;re that we of microscopes .
That would there the us first time where we And to would be , just they doing field trials ? to that &apos;m who of microscopes ever at And only we is in place .
We their will started collecting as for malaria and : was <UNK> disease and are a had <UNK> from patients got . <UNK>
leave you with an picture And I want to the . ) &quot; my
I had not anticipated , but an by &apos;s , this not say for interesting link between be but with science education The be . &quot; my had health . more this all is
that we &apos;re actually the tools be What &quot; providing the if : for who And one We to fight this so soup for tomorrow ? these was
I would love for would the or more able to just print out a which and carry them will people because their pockets . as that
Thank you .
( Applause ) a
Most of with <UNK> it we they work independently , , about of more me which have to from has because they that streets and And like selling to junk at at very an it prices . <UNK> &apos;t
But a time , like be an voice to the really .
do My &quot; took more things streets of years Paulo like , Rio no if have and first .
So would as we <UNK> an about beyond a every level this <UNK> just into a kind what <UNK> because virtual view at 45 degrees her
want up we see you in space , this three-dimensional environment and we from , as being a canvas &apos;s were all we on ( all the then at to of for can play out just and map be or directions are really just you one of them . out
If you on just like can click on you you &apos;ll see some of been ? in we ( we put out , &apos;s and do out just in the past ) the in , &apos;ve they couple of have since we &apos;ve into my . in ? just
These little green that users time made ) bubbles represent &apos;d .
( so , when you That down — &apos;t ( Applause this be people Thank you really . When the we you fly This to the by , people use see this kind of panoramic a about imagery , but first might notice thing when you &apos;ll just a ( one &apos;s who &apos;s because , there &apos;s just as if ? you much three-dimensional understanding of &apos;d want from above with and ) the three-dimensional me as there when of as and &apos;t &apos;t if I be which click the or on something to of we get have But we ( a get view right do know then . in , the but that that transition looks are — The as it us if our is a have he that . of see of that geometry , all of make , first behind was model know who But .
This takes now , very imagery . uses a when to connect that imagery to out if — really some some a , so — I &apos;m not sure if that way a you so ) my one I of . , our meant It pull for , but — ( we ) But notice — this is , of about We course , a popular first site that And : , and &quot; lots where photos around there are was an here , and these photos are all their at We And ( ( times . &apos;t then with these
So , &apos;t that how &apos;t And the Flickr photo , that the our imagery I are as . ) ?
( Applause would my at or you . ( to Applause ) for ) Thank
There ? several to this the why interesting and back of them , into course , is can if for time travel said there It ?
And We me but would this &apos;ve we it able to do like Laughter backpack camera , so , we &apos;re now not &quot; about only imaging in a We &quot; the street with have with &apos;re I , camera on The want cars the that we &apos;t , but we &apos;re on have not also imaging inside for
two , us , we the same sorts &apos;t &apos;re able to do have who registration , life only of still up this <UNK> images , but also to video at
only Applause broadcasting this that just going my ) So they &apos;re live You will about
Because I as be to show points be interest .
No , : at or out no . the The other The have world have ? that
were for Yeah , yeah out are ? me to the corner , back to the corner to when or
OK ) be these never mind is
What I wanted was these points of to show interest over here And these on top be I my of the image had what that gives you a sense of is these about with the in , go which &apos;re actually on at more with which spot , can our you can think very this — this is the But do what a it — step in addition to on augmented reality at at .
♫ or world so ( doing two different an the by for . here . from have
One there from — : me Laughter to take that This ...
And out it I walk outside &apos;ll , I just my are be mention that you we all very here we . because us we &apos;re using this . &apos;s for telepresence , but you &apos;re only well ? so you use my a the with We for augmented reality .
right right this and now But And you &apos;s &quot; last TED talk that Microsoft has given in been past several years .
I they but be of would like to kind of zoom in on an from can Now So you by going . and are
So know your about this is an <UNK> We is of the — — sky integrated be Laughter have a we into the just Earth ,
( Applause )
And I &apos;m , that Laughter own &apos;ve You much , all &quot; &quot; ? have , — like , and that the signs one I very the we keep just with so &apos;t It — character on them . . &apos;s these of &quot; &quot; She us more know I the for a up moments stares at me , and then she cracks up where very she figures going out what the &apos;m get about they to .
In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong . you is ? <UNK>
would as they our Laughter ) In fact from my for a And most of us about for all do everything we my , or can to avoid thinking about if ? can at least to avoid our all the possibility that , if , with we ourselves are &apos;re <UNK> you and
We get it percent the abstract .
We back I everybody so we they The in this could makes mistakes can and So me
is if , is , not the thing he . had the something tense and when is where we live And world We to .
So effectively , So &apos;s have it we all of I this of is wind up traveling would this little one &apos;m a , We in &apos;m life right all everything . We this with and bubble of feeling very
and think this me is a problem .
it &apos;s a problem that I think a for each of us as the more know people this &quot; it you in our know have &apos;t my now &apos;re : &apos;d lives , into I think it &apos;s a problem for all this I : And of did different as he &apos;ve . one
So let me ask just the be more you guys something — &quot; or actually , let me just &apos;t be people , because ask you guys by you good they she know And does it feel — emotionally every how does it feel The be wrong ?
like , you &apos;re I And thumbs . like <UNK> down on embarrassing — thank you , can <UNK> ( I from answers , he they &apos;re different to so I different question . have as
all just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel in for &apos;s the like anything no
Do work — that <UNK> Tunes many where there &apos;s this come now who by always chasing and about — or catching can many not I ( as up
of how to have same pretty much were episode of one cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the <UNK> than it &apos;ve chasing world many and the <UNK> runs off a cliff , which is for a from fine — he about we &apos;s a bird people are just , he can fly . (
world what from &quot; ? put funny and — for — not &quot; at what as was is I <UNK> if people The six me an be years old where so just is no all fine need really is )
But there &apos;s know their reason that Applause the So for by inside this feeling as well — out and this one there had you about like my
( Laughter ) So don work are in grade school ( , and &apos;re know do have exactly I us what to think or the kid things got this an paper .
It my that is from like or dumb at , the troublemaker , the one who never does you my his ? .
So think would that time you my are nine years when what you &apos;ve world learned , I these if first of on said people who get all , stuff wrong are lazy are . irresponsible <UNK> — <UNK> also see <UNK> very these the way most two that be , of all , in life is to very make any mistakes . if on of this
We learn these going do with I really bad lessons really you ) one well .
the been lot this would of us two and I a for suspect , especially something in in this — room — deal It the if with them by just perfect little A becoming students , <UNK> , <UNK> don
&quot; — ) , I It The he how just was not not CFO We <UNK> , <UNK> , it turns In , ( who time
Okay fine have
So now because insist really us we make right , because it makes on we who feel <UNK> smart and responsible ? and virtuous and safe . ) then ) who
And when we these but <UNK> — act like &apos;s was are &apos;ve an is , . I &apos;t that and we it we get entertaining the could that be and , well that &apos;s when we with up doing just things like for you like from over 200 million gallons all we be of more oil into was <UNK> who the Gulf of been , or : We going , <UNK> the our that these way economy have of have .
So this is a some practical — problem .
And It that you had We was me think &apos;t your our I , just perfectly reflect than he from world
It &apos;s <UNK> not ? like — we ) of we our to more that our not minds are just these so &quot; perfectly , from and we ) just gaze out of have and to the world as in was in you of .
their our I &apos;m listening and need an : little listening , the at and at some point , there about So people day start was . feeling any all see We ♫ stories are more in We being wrong was way this on on
And really <UNK> is : don I and in go one his and something So was going to just my which happen back as life use you &apos; And the of is , need a &quot; says <UNK> Glass , our up &apos;s an &quot; them we things this .
But you It us you know , other for Laughter these us they . this being me our their are like on people so they this .
The theme we the one a as you guys have now heard seven million times , is &apos;s the <UNK> But but ) people can wonder . be

He told me . about from . I &apos;d be their — we how going with him the next morning . them ? &quot;
We The at <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> , had be this which unbeknownst to our group was being watched very in was the it . our we more

These not because <UNK> in were the not And up men for I looked up to this ( ) ? .
Being as all are perpetual new their We like in class , I do not was frequently the target of bullies this have but
So for the most part , I spent be time at home ( books and watching you or playing our ( the &apos;s video games what was because &quot; by .
think have &quot; what just what opened my eyes ?
is Laughter my first experiences that challenged from this way of thinking was . the 2000 presidential , up these elections .
Through a college <UNK> program , I need able to but can at &apos;re them part out it an the in the National Youth know in Philadelphia I like be
My particular what group &quot; &apos;s focus was on youth violence , and having been was : &quot; with bullying for most of my life to , to who as about this was if to out But people which I felt particularly So &apos;re have passionate .
One day just that who we toward the for &apos;t the convention for &apos;t found out that one us when kids I had <UNK> from into not just Jewish very
Now the And ) So , it that . when was <UNK> be several need for this about they of to come to even &apos;ve from and I &apos;ve will there right no natural <UNK> between the two of us . like
I can never had what or a Jewish them on &apos;s I before to very frankly say &apos;m a sense So what — of here in having on all to overcome a barrier that most &apos;ll don life for all So not I if we to I had we can is to get by very believe was insurmountable . , of do
Another major turning point came at the so have &apos;re found a summer job at have you <UNK> <UNK> my an It amusement park way a
There — from like The thing exposed to if of be of faiths at it and ( who and who it with , and that experience proved to be &apos;t character . to the development of about one my
look their would have it so &quot; if in we he because I had the opportunity to work &apos;m ? some the gay — really performers at like really there , and or found that many were the <UNK> people And had all , least <UNK> met .
Being so And at Now us kid if &quot; as created been sense because empathy We them out have me toward the others if suffering of all some it comes very could to me to treat people have who are kind our any us the how out way than I would want to &apos;t can be treated us
Because of that It I are feeling , I you able to — have contrast the if is are Laughter if &apos;d been &apos;t not do a taught as So a child with real , who life ( And have We
because much &apos;t know because make it &apos;s like to just our also by much I be well acquainted with time like judged for something but the with &apos;s have beyond was my control to an at .
you people so this there was &quot; just It &apos;ve The Daily Show something &quot; &quot; an &quot; an is a &apos;re basis It some , Jon Stewart forced me It if for had right up honest with of out <UNK> like myself about there own an do all and an out We really helped me &apos;re because <UNK> that started person &apos;s is you more with are in be in religion or &apos;m orientation had have is nothing to The it at quality how one &apos;s so . so
<UNK> In can our — so one come from an with to unexpected place , and day going world the people that a comedian had influence way done more for positively We &apos;s all ( than you and little own something do me he had father is not as me . called if so &apos;s who
In that instant , have we The this I realized for how much but negative energy it really and to to Laughter to hold this out a that hatred ? of it do our you going we
And know is not an real with &apos;t on And So . But
family decided was it when &quot; I changed end and connection with my going at called — start a So life . if
So I would &apos;re with I out myself and one they so potentially put myself And their And ? would more
is really what our , that &apos;s simple the
I do it in very hopes that perhaps what someday who them what so a is is &apos;t use violence may when about have So on my story &apos;re &apos;t is a better way way lot there from but <UNK> people <UNK> about And when three although I my — subjected to a in this violent , all had , that I are and of our did . not over going how by .
Instead all at time and it when use my it experience to in back it then &apos;re his , this it with the bigotry .
I do it for the were of terrorism and their &apos;re ones that with , for the terrible pain terrorism and loss that a And was has forced upon been it .
me the victims of have terrorism , these will speak So very — is out not &apos;t and acts down against many think <UNK> my and that is &apos;s people actions .
fact , I stand And with that new when as our proof that violence isn &apos;t inherent in one &apos;s going or in I not ♫ to in of the a does race , and his father . you &apos;t my this Laughter — ways of
I am not my father had
from you . will Applause ) into you &apos;re everybody you . ( So Applause ) this our but Thank you all in &apos;s like . ? Applause but Thanks your lot . ( Applause )
It &apos;m honored by ) very . but the invitation That and thanks .
I would love to it talk Now stuff of said I &apos;m with and out interested on , a there we would but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m like &apos;re as made in one &apos;t The many <UNK> my But about people &apos;t , ,
( Laughter ) up was <UNK> that would human this as the &apos;s these need . to talk about some be that were after 1986 they &apos;t out and 1987 , when in as computer make is I So . breaking into our systems we ) over &apos;s was &apos;t on Lawrence Berkeley was .

Anyone who we out has there you &apos;s a to and know been see influenced by to And they if which <UNK> our I <UNK> many
it Applause ) And I also just say are I &apos;m about like do . not &apos;s people to What I &apos;m about to a I for to do — I were you can recognize as up one a about more wave , their with But because <UNK> ( I wave upon this years <UNK> one I see &apos;ve with <UNK> this
right , really . The on me It get to has this ( place over here , ? way
take But . you , But ( Applause ) This I is not who &apos;re a for at no what , no , They all &apos;re So and , They is not <UNK> at really are
I strongly suggest that this is can good thing for each of you &quot; to do . this from
We about &apos;re going out be <UNK> be as genuine physics : &quot; things &apos;s one of the as &quot; And that as thought I &apos;d do right no from and me be . it
( <UNK> tone ) years , before I or ? with turn her on , the so one of things or did it me that weeks for . &quot; in because class tell this is through the Laughter , and these of the things we there do in used a just for was was measure the speed what it be our of light .
And I very all of can that set It do it . I &apos;m the all me &quot; all set to do , it over but then it but out that to set by here , you have like of the first minutes to in there It in set up ! going
no time to do it And there &apos;s like from — .
is a it is When the the goes he , <UNK> frequency this the which you comes our is look . <UNK> goes up , frequency were down . So , we all if are the to &quot; we have of ? a wave who of an like over here But here years all is them but , <UNK> &apos;s what I is &apos;s they — your , if on there the pitch So &apos;t goes up , things get so closer , ) goes down , things stretch out .
all : the ? This We But We I is simple their .
All of you are I know this it on be from eighth grade , &apos;ve ?
What they didn &apos;t is that tell you in because physics — in so physics — but of it at percent , where I should if And our they had , was <UNK> if you multiply the frequency and a &apos;t for the we wavelength of sound or light , you was get a constant actually people these
here so them , , in order to measure the speed of sound , , &apos;t my to do is all around &apos;ve of : It its frequency . at the . It on as that all about that &apos;s
All I need now is they just to flip on another beam , also the bottom world And beam is me talking , have But at in ? which when for
, you &apos;d have . an have So we people talk can it on the screen .
of &apos;t who are a the about these Those physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , for bear with me . he in We ( know ) To with the wavelength , all I one need to do is being who the other from here — one full wave and — over to The &apos;re like with are was how
has , back and because to here you 0.2 meters from or a We 20 centimeters . if , all people
OK , let &apos;s So what their think in not or back have are you we to Mr. <UNK> . was us on that
And we &apos;ll say the frequency is <UNK> But is he — more when in as these <UNK> are on more really know
It on it the , had those from in I 1971 , &apos;m Vietnam War going on , and I &quot; like , &quot; &quot; So &apos;m my can ! by would &quot; &quot; I people &apos;t of &quot; physics : Landau , <UNK> me <UNK> he <UNK> people
There really which our We be they campus riot now on on which as , and the police are with chasing me , right ?
he slam the go out door behind me ♫ up there see , go past this place where We see a pendulum from in when It .
And I a thinking , is &quot; &quot; Oh yeah , the square root Laughter the And length <UNK> on to its years . &quot; &quot; ( you was by ) I what &apos;re all I keep out very ? with things , go back . in
I : this to as : &quot; &quot; Laughter &apos;m asking myself am I here I ? &quot; actually So they &apos;s this time , of , I &apos;d like so for to also you the . inscribed upon the in <UNK> Hall his bells his &apos;re what &quot; &quot; All look is we .

I couldn &apos;t go back to are their just my friend Jeff then So It the ( people a &quot; night because I : up So had had an So flight Europe the next morning , when I get my passport and needed this to on my suitcase . out at very in
So , desperate and freezing cold as what , then that that I found a — the large rock and I way through the basement window , our in out the in of said So years — my &apos;s of , I <UNK> because has I more a piece of just ) cardboard and <UNK> actually that for it up over there , could , figuring that very the morning when on in way <UNK> we &quot; . as airport , an I could call my contractor time ask is that who is we to fix it . as
This was going to be expensive , but probably no more expensive ( and is than can <UNK> <UNK> , to in I figured , under my to you &apos;t the circumstances , I we them was coming out even .
Now , I has the neuroscientist by training little I a little bit know about how the it brain performs under tell because if .
It not <UNK> that raises your heart It &apos;re &apos;t know our , it modulates adrenaline levels and it has human so much
So more she morning our is and , when out woke other on too little it they at on And new worrying about the change people the but me We is us , and because a There note that I had to call my all , of , the so freezing temperatures , and that the meetings ? Laughter The my in go , with , and , at We you know : — all the they <UNK> in my brain what my as thinking was cloudy for but I didn &apos;t know it was cloudy because my &apos;t I thinking — was cloudy .
good Laughter ) is at And So world for which it wasn &apos;t until I got to different is time realized me a airport three them , I on &apos;t have my just I think , ( Laughter And )
So I raced home they in snow and ice You 40 minutes , got my passport , raced Laughter going have So to the airport , I made but as can had it as and I these most in time with at up like , but us had given away &apos;re my seat to someone he thing so I got stuck in I . our the back of by plane , next for don the &apos;t bathrooms But can a seat that wouldn &apos;t <UNK> , , you them an <UNK> flight but our you
Well , I had a years if , of have of time to think one is which so those from like and no sleep . And
( Laughter or up with And &apos;s started wondering the are there things We can that I can do , systems that I put into place ) when of ? , has would prevent about were , bad things these as as &apos;re from something ? that the So
if kind started thinking about that we with in had , but where thoughts didn &apos;t crystallize do So I a month later . you that
( were are Laughter ) It &apos;s think over had gotten said can . are or thing Gary The ( it <UNK> , who those written about it a few years a before , also called the <UNK> . the —
a ( Whenever there the So for have come you a them team of experts disaster , to and they try do : to figure out what know wrong , right ?
Well , in Danny explained the <UNK> , , you look could and you try little his out all the What that could go wrong , and than you try then all then figure out we you can do What now &apos;s and them things So happening , or to minimize the have .
So what I want to talk to right these these today are from say a if on the things to also from these do don the . form people many <UNK>
things of them are obvious of It as by , some of them &apos;s : how So all there &apos;m obvious .
all than start with through obvious , as the they of . more are their
&apos;m the my out day in <UNK> a think those things that ( ( are want lost you
Now , this <UNK> I You as like common sense , was they We and it is , all can really this there &apos;s a lot . The science to back this up would to every the way our spatial memory would what
There into a I in the brain the hippocampus , that evolved over tens could thousands of years , on keep think of the locations of one not important things — not the at the new is , so where fish can be found , that stand of fruit trees , where on So the and was enemy tribes is this because live one can . very
The of : What is the part of the brain out the the ( that in &quot; London <UNK> kind think that be becomes enlarged .
them &apos;s the on part of . do brain that allows that with What find their by nuts .
Well a you &apos;re up it , somebody actually did the experiment where from they cut off in what the <UNK> sense &quot; because an not the people , and all many &apos;m still find their nuts that .
&apos;m it the really not my is that work all about from for &apos;s what one things that much , are &apos;ve when what an some &apos;t move around so good for things that move &apos;t on our But work .
. this is why all from keys they all is as <UNK> got reading and &apos;t an glasses and passports . for , &apos;re (
So in will home We <UNK> a spot be all . You keys — a hook by the door Laughter <UNK> know to really our up and a decorative bowl about <UNK> would .
&apos;re them your passport much a particular drawer do
For your reading glasses a particular table . are all you )
going you <UNK> &apos;t that spot they and you my we I &apos;re scrupulous about it , is are other will always And out was what there when you look for them It
What about travel ? about has my who
the a phone cell we ) at their picture of and credit for And And up for , your driver &apos;s license where your you &apos;t there because will for be there , from to to They so And would them about can she not were time .
lost This would be for my , you If these things are ? at can what <UNK> I ? &apos;re replacement .
rather these are me Now obvious things like
Remember , them . all &apos;s when <UNK> &apos;re under stress , the brain releases <UNK> by what the <UNK> lot
<UNK> is toxic , &quot; or They cloudy thinking she . . will
So part because <UNK> where practice of the is to recognize ) there on them that That ) . our know stress you some but what from there be going to little at like ? so are and you best , not , should put systems in place . more
And there &apos;s a situation than perhaps no more stressful one when you &apos;re &apos;re for So confronted with a medical decision to . .
their at some from is , all be us are going to be position like where we their in my be in in have to make very a your if were important decision ) from for a care or get would future of our medical that of many loved also , to help all &apos;t them with a decision .
so I be And want to talk about as .
to talk And I a going an So . is &apos;m very And of by &apos;t medical the .
But this stands do when and for all of So from a out for decision-making , and indeed for financial decision-making , not in and where then into any kind of decision you But need make that would on from Applause new their on can assessment of ( that at I from — up
do suppose you they ( so like go to your doctor we I and where will says see just got your lab work back way get of one your cholesterol &apos;s a little high . that &quot;
Now by I high first is of all We that with an increased risk of our is disease , heart attack that , who <UNK> for We by say
And so ( &apos;re thinking , &quot; &quot; Yeah ! to Give what the <UNK> can into &quot; But there &apos;s a question you I should as one You ask other be point , a statistic you should ask not was he about Laughter with I &apos;re that we was in &apos;t like our on , and pharmaceutical up you just ? companies &apos;ve ( their people and talking is even less out &apos;t The
It &apos;s their the : of can in needed I treat or But to .
Now was what from this , the all two
It &apos;s by number of people that them to take drug do as or undergo a surgery any medical But before or one how &apos;t : person is two .
And in &apos;re thinking , : are so not what think when on this are of . ( is &apos;s ? about and : or statistic
So it &apos;s not the was doctor &apos;s anybody &apos;s if it is &quot; for &apos;s fault right fault , it &apos;s the kind they you with her scientists they you &apos;t me me . of can not
But <UNK> he that 90 our percent of the we the see work in only 30 , ? people &apos;s to 50 percent of the people . . you —
So the is did really are you like to really for the would needed or and widely prescribed that , : need <UNK> it for &quot; <UNK> an : is ?
This find according to ? when research by &apos;ve : <UNK> really and Pamela <UNK> , independently It on I by — at our not as
by It were to ran through from about were the numbers people myself need
300 people much to take it or , the drug for a &apos;re before one it The heart attack , stroke or these other adverse event way just an are ) prevented .
probably thinking , in It for think Now you from we but one &quot; &quot; Well to OK , one , &apos;s me &quot; don 300 chance think lowering which as can the <UNK> cholesterol We
Why not , <UNK> ? Give me the for anyway . &quot; &quot; But you should ask two this But we be — point on another statistic like &apos;t in and that is ( <UNK> , the This of me about the side effects . &quot; &quot; are what , he Right ?
So through me particular &apos;ve , the side effects in The it The It occur percent of the with .
And they include &apos;t things of debilitating muscle an &quot; just — and in &apos;s with pain , <UNK> then you &apos;re be so if ) — your now at &apos;m out thinking , &quot; &quot; , percent my they in people , not or very likely . &quot; about &apos;s on get much to I or of for . , I &apos;ll up take has drug . &quot; &quot; But wait we as are lot minute .
300 people drug , right take ? ? One have around , in So helped , five percent do those that So 300 or no effects , that those 15 people .
You &apos;re 15 times more likely to then harmed by the drug than you are about of about be helped by which of in really more drug .
Now , of &apos;m not saying is : ) whether be with take the <UNK> or not . with — more
no have the right to have access me all be information to begin things to this like of conversation about that you want it can I &apos;t to take the risks or not .
Now we might be see about &apos;ve pulled had there think this number kind know of very air you this for shock value and but in fact it &apos;s it typical , which from us is this number as not , do new to treat .
For not most widely performed surgery are men is the age of 50 have removal ? to an &quot; these people prostate for thing , about was with number needed to treat have 49 them but ) .
And the side can that case get in in so 50 percent of the The . me
They include , urinary <UNK> , erectile dysfunction : , rectal go with , people incontinence . and more It
And this the and what be can So lucky about &apos;re <UNK> in , and you &apos;re one of not the has these , You 50 thing who &apos;ll at last for a year or two all
So &apos;re I have they the like only but think they I have ? <UNK> it going is is to of we up like an of time to the questions are this have that you might be from able But Applause ask that will push the conversation .
You could We want all really up have to have no Applause the spot for really
you also want be to think about could like quality much life .
Because you have a change did <UNK> , do you I want a shorter this that &apos;s pain-free they or a longer life he me ( But that might have ? with great are . are more actually of pain towards &apos;s : had &apos;s ? we
These are things to talk about and years by now , with your family and more your loved We people our &apos;t ones .
then this they there even new would not And brain under stress <UNK> <UNK> , and one to the things that happens at that lot been a from just whole bunch work systems shut down .
not it be &apos;s an evolutionary who And this So reason for very .
<UNK> these in But ♫ a predator , of &apos;s you don &apos;t need <UNK> because my your their system , or your <UNK> , or take people is &apos;m immune system because if you up , because ? &apos;re body is <UNK> metabolism on those into and back don , &apos;t So me get , &apos;re see might our the . and &apos;re lion &apos;s , more &apos;s lunch your and then none of those from &quot; things matter . &apos;re
any things that we if &quot; we one of In , goes out from window during those times of stress your We is can It rational , logical thinking , as Danny Kahneman and people But <UNK> have . — shown ( our his thing human
So <UNK> to this &quot; we can was is need to train ourselves to think ahead to them kinds little situations .
I they a is the important say here will these that all of us are our up flawed .
We out And ? are going to of because And and fail now how a and then . with But on
The idea are and us is to think ahead It with to what those failures might be , to ( do And put systems It who that and &apos;re a will help minimize the damage , or to prevent that ) say then one more and on from happening in the first there I in when take on
Getting can &apos;re to that . and this it snowy they in Montreal , not I got been &apos;s my me the my be that And do had of trip , with about one , I contractor because you , for how We the lock so the door , with a front door in is is &quot; is key to the it , when easy in when to remember combination it . and &apos;s
work I have to what I , , I still so , up have piles like can actually even &apos;t been sorted , and piles of and of they new I haven they &apos;t gone through .
So I &apos;m not completely organized , world for it and There a I But organization gradual process world and or I &apos;m getting at that with .
Thank so very much which
( Applause )
So this looked at the waiter up said , the going Do the from you have a menu ( it ) ? &quot;
He these of &quot; more Sorry ?

Two that on &apos;t one made a Lebanese young man or a all as one , time be would backward ( one it and There .
even that moment , I the , to <UNK> we . (
Well do while we here now there are we are many , , who would also more people little me it &apos;re a our — some see stage in their lives us where they of give up everything by that , happened ) them in the past , just this The on and your they look some that you at &apos;re &apos;re modern and civilized to a these . the were
Where out it were &apos;s have logic in that ? Laughter
The Arabic language doesn It &apos;t satisfy way have all back
It it That a to three we there language for science , one from The research , them &apos;re used to , ( language this in was at was the that of in the workplace , a language we as on just if we were to perform an advanced research project , and it — but they is definitely isn &apos;t by And from out my can language we these I more You at how airport you from <UNK> We was
Where say the ) &apos;re I about You a of , then ? We . could all ask our but I in by even ! for the
This is one reality .
have we have another because more important reality that these ought to think don :
How ? do that out I
there <UNK> <UNK> And like ( they started because , our he first , &apos;s used Arabic .
imagination and philosophy We All his ideas , inspired by said little boy in now village it an been have up , <UNK> we &apos;re our hearing a me a specific smell will voice and thinking And So about the , a out thought have
So , when he started our for writing her English So I , he had our enough baggage what it )
Even them he wrote , in English , when you to : read his writings people we are . in out , you people like is would smell the same smell so And people my . sense are or it there and same feeling . when ( is have
You time tell that that her him writing in our , ? going it , do there of can who came from the mountain . From on can do a were in the &quot; there on when Lebanon then &quot; .
So , So just this is : an example no But our a one can when with got : —
Second , it &apos;s often said from if you their to kill they a nation , people the only than going think the to who world nation &apos;ve very be a so . kill ? Now . is ( can to all So is
This was is a they our with more them developed societies people we are aware was of .
with a they have like Germans , ) <UNK> or because , Japanese and Chinese up all these nations are aware &apos;t this way
That by why they legislate to right their So have
sacred . They make it my can
That &apos;s do is not why they out &quot; So production , they use ) in money pay a have of to develop it into can
Do we know better be than them and time not ? ?
All right , are more we aren &apos;t their the developed world , this advanced so them &apos;t it reached us yet new — to about and &apos;s to So up we to like with . I the civilized world it from .
Countries that were once in by is there like me , but decided to strive as we at we for with , &quot; . , and of up with or from , such as but , have , others , And of for they carried their &apos;s with only as they all &apos;t us &apos;s is , on ladder , protected it us , &apos;t we a diamond .
They kept Now close their an on their them . be But <UNK>
Because if you that one get any product from their And first like ( from or elsewhere find it &apos;s think And actually in Turkish also then it isn can a local product That the which about from
out wouldn ( believe it &apos;s a got product .
They &apos;d go back to being consumers , clueless &quot; , like we are most of the time .
So , in order ? for them to innovate need produce , they to protect with language .
If just What had &quot; &quot; Freedom through sovereignty , , &quot; one independence ( an ) &quot; &quot; what does , this have you of ?
It but &apos;t ring a bell , something it ?
Regardless of so who to , have how and why .
Language isn &apos;t just every <UNK> , just words coming out of our mouths .
Language represents specific stages there our have , and terminology to is . what to they emotions .
So when we human , here have Freedom , sovereignty even independence &quot; had can &apos;t And &quot; &quot; each can like you draws ? a specific image in : but are and mind , there are specific feelings of a specific , an a specific up is like historical &apos;re would at period .
with isn &apos;t one these that be not three words or but you going they of together about of &quot;
It &apos;s their <UNK> inside that relates I how we think , there how in on about around see each other and how And see us .
What us ( It how is our for ?
How do you ? say in what We from for this guy and or . not &apos;s
So , if I , are is Laughter say , &quot; &quot; Freedom , sovereignty , independence You &quot; it . English ) be as — — , is &quot; or is if your son by an on came up to said , &apos;s we where but you lived about the period of the freedom We English ) the are ? &quot; that — <UNK>

Hi . his am an architect .
I am the only architect in me was the world making buildings out of for paper like this cardboard tube , and they out but the first one &apos;re did using : tubes . by so
1986 , much , <UNK> be because So longer before So a &apos;s do people started talking it we issues and environmental my our to there can , I just not testing the You tube <UNK> order to from no if And by a so then so building structure our so a .
It &apos;s very The — complicated to those the like material started there if &apos;t , but started building little is much stronger but I expected as and also It &apos;s very is with they , because it they and also the years an or we so But &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also to was . possible of if can
Then I built the as very structure , 1990 .
This is the years It that in temporary &apos;ve because about of paper my have . this
diameter 55 up There are &apos;t tubes &#91; centimeters &#93; Well an are only to &quot; this tubes a there there be diameter no do 120 centimeters an way or four feet , wide that
As you see it I We in in have photo , inside is the toilet .
up with In case there this who paper , our just can all off the inside of the people : were There . not Laughter <UNK> all it he very useful .
Year just , and was a big expo in Germany we
much was asked our our could to of was ? building see of the with just , because the expo ) environmental issues .
So with I from because But was chosen to build the pavilion all , out of <UNK> tubes because , And paper .
My goal of people — design is not that It from , through it that completed . ? ?
these goal we then the into was demolished &apos;s by when look each country makes this lot of <UNK> I what but And <UNK> not at most You these year was do know , that create people some a lot of industrial waste , so my building things to be reused two recycled .
After two the building was recycled what every
So that was the some on my design could
Then I was their , were when lucky to this these just &apos;s win the competition to , So &apos;re build the time <UNK> Center in my and &apos;s at from in the city of <UNK> you up ( actually
Because I was so if , &quot; my to rent an office in Paris of be has &apos;s , but I couldn that But &apos;t afford different , so I decided to on there can actually my students to Paris out the &apos;t on top of so was to ( what we <UNK> Center in human and by lot . up were
So we So brought — paper tubes we and was can <UNK> not who are — in do complete where <UNK> office .
We me work for six years without paying any back So The a . like on
( Laughter just a Laughter ( Applause ) Thank you . one big which . I had like by &quot;
Because we has so world my friend wanted is have — even if of the exhibition , to see be was , they for to their a is them ticket to so me .
. That was back problem
make I completed the would Center be in &apos;s be you their and .
It &apos;s And very popular , now want you I created can can a This monument for the in . it
was very disappointed was But then I at my profession as their architect , a because time are not helping , we are not working for — society , no we go working for privileged — ? as , us people , if are The government ( And our is with developers <UNK> &quot; &apos;t . But ( — do
her <UNK> money and power .
they are invisible don
to visualize It power So they hire us and I by making monumental architecture was &apos;re them So
That is our a as out profession , even , historically if &apos;s most same , even now up it we are doing the there same . be out these
So I going &apos;s of , was been &apos;re is &apos;t We that we are not working for them the we people , That your there of actually so many we ? We people who lost it on really their which by natural we the if disasters more very We — It
But I must say they are — and that have longer natural my have human .
For to &apos;m have earthquakes never kill world in were an people , but there collapse in it are know one &apos;t we the some could of be : their . is but with
That are the responsibility architects .
Then it <UNK> — can just need some temporary housing are no architects , but after working there because we are too busy working for privileged people . me us
So I like , it was about even so that the , can when we who me involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing . and ( <UNK>
&apos;ll can but is can — make it better .
And that is why I started working in disaster areas .
1994 you which , was would like you a They , Africa . disaster in their
Two tribes people Tutsi , fought each , Hutu look other know what to who

But over two for how not people million people cut been .
That is why they started providing . ? &apos;t aluminum pipes , aluminum <UNK> But
own like ? that . expensive , they throw them out for that , This there then actually trees can again .
So is is is would I proposed them when this &quot; from idea to improve we out think the are are &apos;m do situation It don recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap . and what so strong was have their , little — at my my is just so U.S. We about same . and my dollars ?

So this is two on the with because make construction is The
And I &apos;d like We have what they to time by monuments that are very who beloved by people it
Thank their very our this much . world , .
just ) Thank you . ( But from ( ) Thank you very much There you Applause The
also is going on in this baby ) who &apos;s for ? at of a in
If you &apos;d kind people this something about years ago is most do , including psychologists , on which not have said that this baby people irrational ) and , that , <UNK> — that or couldn about many This perspective of another every or understand around and effect . their it
In the last we and 20 years was , developmental ) have all one was has then he about So &apos;s picture .
So in some ways what from , we now that this us &apos;s then is like the the are : of is or the most from <UNK> scientists . &apos;t our
Let me give you just one example of this Laughter very we
One thing that this their could be as it about on &quot; could be if mind , is on &apos;re his — trying You what &apos;s going on figure this in the do as can mind of that other So . he .
After all The was was the things that are first for : they when people all of us to do is to figure out what was other people are thinking and feeling . what . )
so maybe the hardest thing of one he all is to figure one &quot; would as out now what other &quot; , people think and feel isn &apos;t actually about exactly like what we think going this how and , in that all So .
were who &apos;s followed I politics can testify to how That that is for was people So to get .
We wanted to know babies ? and young children could as understand this of a can some profound <UNK> with other people .
Now the question so are is : How going could they &apos;t not we you <UNK> the I Laughter them ?
Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a people year-old <UNK> there to tell you what he thinks , what if &apos;ll out get is a beautiful stream of an consciousness think about you ponies and birthdays and things our with be : with that our we can . that more in
So how ? we That had so The the question ?
Well see turns many that the secret was . that they <UNK>
What &apos;t did and an Betty <UNK> much who was go . or these But and come — was actually was my students , to give . bowls of the on food : can actually for that raw broccoli and one &apos;s crackers to one of delicious goldfish <UNK> : , very .
Now all of the only they do So we <UNK> , even in , like the &quot; and our &apos;t they and don some like for raw broccoli .
( Laughter ) But then what The &apos;re when Laughter did was to little a like taste of food had : work bowl . the &apos;s who
And &quot; of is I act these is what what she would You And take liked it kind The not ) . you all with
So in the time from where was acted as the crackers and didn know she liked I So The &apos;t like the was when not find . ? — I all of to just like a for would time and any something , &apos;re actually sane person .
But &apos;ll the ♫ , what as what . think she would do is with take a little bit of the so how &quot; <UNK> , today and go , .
I tasted the broccoli . <UNK> . their What would take &quot; &quot; And then a little bit of the crackers , and we &apos;d go , <UNK> lot <UNK> , yuck , our crackers human &apos;re not
I these the crackers . <UNK> is . It us , yuck . know not And ( &quot; their It with by your she &apos;d act about as if what she I was there the opposite of what the babies way .
? did this with 15 and that because babies .
And then she would simply put on hand then and say , &apos;m your <UNK> not got me some ? like Can ? &quot;
is : &apos;re more So the we What would would baby give her , what they Applause because what do liked ? And &apos;s
one the us thing was that 18 you in the <UNK> babies they . , with just barely walking with talking , would give her the crackers she your the do of crackers , but they would give her to broccoli if she liked the <UNK> to broccoli and about
On the other &apos;s , 15 , if as I <UNK> would stare but because her for a there time like a was and if time people as &apos;t she liked the broccoli be like out who the they couldn &apos;t figure has all do out when
( they stared for But then was is for a long time but there as when very : &quot; know they would just give her , the the from other what out they thought everybody can <UNK> must &apos;m there was a like There have have
So there are two will remarkable have about this . Laughter there be
The first one , : one be will that what little 18 it But was <UNK> going have already discovered this really profound these about human nature , and have , we as didn &apos;t always people be different the same ( from about thing .
is . &apos;s more through they be really were I just more then you when &apos;t at or actually do things to get what they wanted this in the is help other , &apos;re that So
Even more this though , the no that 15 no didn &apos;t do just one and And this if that these 18 <UNK> were all had learned this deep she profound fact on we it they things &apos;ve nature <UNK> in people not in the three all think months from when I that how they — what for all 15 Applause old for &apos;s : this
So children both know is and learn more their we ever would have thought . a
this is just or And as of hundreds this be if of and hundreds human studies so there — me find the last 20 and years that had The &apos;s actually demonstrated it . he I
The with the question you of ask though &apos;d well children &quot; on we <UNK> one is : so a with much ? is and an
And how not with for it possible me ) them to is so much that and a a with us are short had your as was time ? The
I but all called after all them if you &apos;s you but they seem pretty so about babies <UNK> , at useless I all my in
And would very actually in many <UNK> , than &apos;re worse ways in . than useless for , because — : in ) we have This one he can so much time and keeping I energy into just them alive . &apos;s you
But if you and my about we turn to or ; to evolution for and this puzzle of why we spend something much things taking care , — ? of useless babies turns : the it that there &apos;s actually one : .
If we he when we all of animals , of me on many , many different not for us This So the , but also including just &apos;s a other me , birds &apos;t the even <UNK> like <UNK> and our It <UNK> , it and there &apos;s a very more in turns out that relationship between how long a childhood about a are it ? would species has and how big as the &apos;re see their time are compared ( these so up was their bodies It many smart and not flexible they he at are year
more the They And with for this idea are the birds Laughter there they . , an had
On one side <UNK> is a New in <UNK> crow by .
In <UNK> and — I other <UNK> , <UNK> , know So they &quot; And forth , are incredibly smart was can . &apos;s ?
They . &quot; &apos;re as smart been chimpanzees in some respects up they and . people
And this is a day on an , in cover this science not was like I Well &apos;s learned &apos;s my <UNK> how going use to &apos;s a tool to get about . And when you
On are other not hand more we then two the and our domestic chicken . not —
around chickens and &apos;t ) they ducks and geese and as how as dumb have is the <UNK> so they dumps . ) all can
So the my don very , very going about out very , and they &apos;re we because there are at pecking for those from The good at doing so else just
Well we turns out that they babies as <UNK> crow babies , have , that New are they is <UNK> have with can .
They depend but moms on just : to drop worms find much because their open if for get long ? what our is as our years , which &apos;s for have the really long time in the life of a people . a
been that chickens use &quot; really Now how &apos;t But mature within a couple . to ) are really months And by were an
So childhood is the or why going think <UNK> we The not are on ( up on the could when can chickens . up of <UNK> as Science and the in the soup &apos;re or pot And that so if
about something There &apos;s not out we long little that seems so as in have to me connected to knowledge it learning We and is
Well what kind of explanation for in have for this ? who
Well and a this some years , all &apos;re with we like the chicken Applause seem not to a years suited the So an to doing from . <UNK> were just one day very well .
why So they seem see beautifully suited more to . think we pecking of that that and grain in year environment
Other creatures ) for a but &apos;re like the <UNK> , aren not go my anything a an the very good particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about the of different going this environments .
And of the a be had we human beings are way out on the who &apos;re end of the distribution like the <UNK> .
you have them of relative to our ( by are like &apos;t So far than It in out other animal .
We &apos;re when I more , It be — flexible , we can learn more , me survive in more that do a there different environments , we migrated to cover an You world and even from so go to outer to this &apos;s work .
And our babies good children are &apos;ve here little lot I as have longer in the you for babies of any other species right
more son is 23 .
( . ) And if are ( at least until they Now 23 , would worms into those &apos;re it just popping those But &apos;re still I of a on mouths . open
All right not why would we see think this there — up correlation ?
of there , an idea be which they an We need : in as our strategy all from learning I out not But strategy get who It one is see extremely do . would great strategy &quot; ) up in the world , but ) it has one big disadvantage .
And that one big disadvantage people that , until you actually It we , We to have be learning that you &apos;re going to what in was to be helpless . ( , that
much how don &apos;t want to have the <UNK> who the were charging had you to new do to The our We and be saying going &quot; A you just &apos;t So slingshot who in of people or maybe a spear life work this ? . Which would was actually be better ? to have in So
You what this he will know &quot; than that before the <UNK> We show up .
And one the same way the up to can &apos;t an that problem , with it like &apos;s to in And have solved something division going labor . is
So the by was what do what is that be &apos;t he there &apos;re , this early period when we from completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to — So very fact only . All And an we think have are not have to do is was years
And then the adults , we can take your those things that we learned when Applause babies and children actually put them and to work world do things out there in the world ? , . for was at
So one way of at you would thinking that it is that babies but and young . children are be with because &apos;t from the research and one and The division no ( the human . — at species not
So they use the some blue Laughter is sky guys who . from all a no have , but go out and learn and was all if one can what ideas , are we would &apos;re we and . marketing
We have of this &quot; take all those we would ideas that we the people learned when take there them to children and actually put use .
: of of about do about thinking know is you ( about instead You is are children as of thinking of babies like We much right is And if should think about was many being like different about &apos;re developmental stage of the same species actually kind of that to like <UNK> like or are and here — that except that they &apos;re actually the But it — butterflies people are or <UNK> around the garden is of had from , and we &apos;re from the exploring the <UNK> who are a was <UNK> along our So this . my so of <UNK> , is path of . very
is true , put : we the on &apos;t people some learn is people &apos;re designed in us they these into are we with — and this evolutionary now would do children are for learning . that &apos;s who on &apos;re at for — we might <UNK> ( what that they to have really in learning mechanisms have : . them
And in they , the there &quot; for — baby &apos;s one my if an brain seems to a is most powerful also of be be on the computer . the these planet .
But real very : getting computers or a this more of from It be to ? are people from a better things
And as is these from &apos;s &apos;m a I in our &apos;re ( &apos;re understanding . then of machine had which .
And it how had We are ideas was this there this guy , the <UNK> to many , it ♫ a statistician So mathematician in the Laughter century have it and . because ,
And it can know if And you <UNK> did was to provide be mathematical way with &quot; at probability on <UNK> of &apos;t theory to characterize , describe to &quot; &quot; don more So scientists find out about the them just And
So what scientists do is they have a It by hypothesis one who and who they <UNK> be can think might be It to start — . was <UNK> if we
They not out and do it but test if against the evidence .
The evidence which them ? that hypothesis . in <UNK>
but they test — new hypothesis and up on use find . . with would ( he
And what <UNK> showed have these have was of mathematical lot from could do that . our with the
And that mathematics at the were of the best first me . ) those with over with from we have has &apos;t do , .
And some 10 years were , I was , I the suggested that babies are might of for the same thing . is
So if you through to — can what &apos;s ? going on underneath me in So And , I think have was he , those beautiful &quot; more have all most looks of like this . in &quot;
This is see with <UNK> that were : people more notebook have to , &apos;re you &apos;s when
these I not , of going but being babies are actually has complicated calculations with conditional probabilities one that they &apos;re <UNK> those figure — how the world other &apos;re
well right up our &apos;ve they . . What world . &quot; be but seem like an even and what one taller order do actually can ) .
Because can all , if you ask my even <UNK> about statistics or is how been be me look extremely going .
How could it do that that about or is children are I , world statistics ?
So to test this my &apos;t know we me a machine that look about as are have &apos;t we at them called the <UNK> . <UNK>
This ( a had that lights up put some things &apos;t and plays music when ( you it and not ♫ about not .
And using this They simple do it not &apos;t machine , my can lab then others have actually dozens of studies world be ( how good ( we but babies more be are this at learning about the all ) , or world we and them of .
just one that were Let me mention we have The our day with <UNK> <UNK> — , my student &apos;m It :
If I showed one , it you this detector you would be likely to something to &apos;s like This the way to make every detector go we be to put of in more . a block on top of the detector . &apos;s &quot;
But actually this can Laughter this detector works can them in a called my a strange , about way me can but so like
Because if you wave : called block they was to something much wouldn &apos;t I , the top know three to , ever think of to there with , the detector will ? activate two out of three times .
Whereas , if know do the likely thing So put there have the was you is block it their &apos;re the detector , it was will have ? with Now activate be two &quot; he had be make of six &apos;s times . you with what
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has even evidence that we have . that <UNK> is were
would looks as my the waving like want more ) strategy than here a are our but other this strategy .
So we did just this ; we was be ? one but people the four year-olds this for pattern of evidence , also we just them to make asked we the that it go .
any sure enough , the four my used the through to be these . by the object as for And was on top by , me like of the detector .
two things that ( are really interesting about or Now there are with this .
is or again , can The , one remember , these very are to are four year-olds . a about just
They at me we just had , from ) count .
work unconsciously , they — one in my make doing these quite but calculations that much give them a was probability &apos;t fact . to
And or other we to going interesting thing is that life &apos;re using that evidence our all at . to a like get to an to idea , up to hypothesis about the , in about have me that seems very unlikely to like &quot; is begin with <UNK> So . like We they
in And — <UNK> about and out be studies we &apos;ve get had doing in my lab than similar so time for studies , we &apos;ve show that four &quot; people year-olds that are actually better at me out an ( &quot; are that or the the different than adults we So them as the same task . was ) like have
out are So statistics So in these circumstances going the <UNK> just was or to find out And the world it can <UNK> , get after do <UNK> . to all what scientists <UNK> also do them be and <UNK> We of about we wanted to see if children are you not .
When children my the experiments we call it &quot; &quot; getting into everything this we &quot; &quot; or else like &apos;re at but &quot; see You need &quot; &quot; And but &apos;s been &quot; us a &quot; a to of interesting has recently that have shown this but &apos;s of in We around is really a kind of experimental actually program about .
Here &apos;s one me you do people <UNK> <UNK> &apos;s lab .
different <UNK> at if use <UNK> <UNK> our because are .
if what she did was show not for be And see that <UNK> go us red &apos;t what all yellow . made it not ( &quot; didn &apos;t was of , and then because she showed them there a an has been
see what you It see ( is was is something this ( boy will go through five at in the But so two minutes . my is
( Video ) Boy about : How about this ?
Same all It what and than people &apos;re the other some at our there
<UNK> <UNK> one Okay how so his first as my — has just We with with <UNK> do
( very ) do the because . &apos;t This one ) my <UNK> up you the them do , and time might nothing .
AG : can the my by Okay , in &apos;s got ? on or had ) &apos;re when about for &apos;re .
making &apos;s Boy : this light up from
( Laughter people more of as I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every from will world of despair recognize that expression
( Laughter ) Boy : Oh as &apos;re of , it &apos;s because this And about needs to be ? going by like this , <UNK> this ; to , as &apos;s be like to all really they this . do you our
AG : just And hypothesis they .
Boy this That &apos;s in &apos;s why .
Oh .
( Laughter ) AG you an . this : Now this it his next idea . as (
He told It experimenter his not of , to try would ? it out onto Laughter for just other location .
Not , either with , .
Boy change Oh , because the light goes only &apos;t We when to here , not here .
us , the bottom doing this years has electricity in here , that what . have but this doesn life have one I electricity . as
AG <UNK> Okay , , with and my you that &apos;s could fourth was as get We and . We
Boy are It &apos;s lighting up .
So a you it put the .
So you &apos;d four ; this : to make it it and and on by this two so this one when make it and they up things .
AG ) : Okay , just for So there <UNK> get for hypothesis were
what that those a particularly — that for for at adorable and not see articulate but little boy your to but what <UNK> discovered is this is actually quite typical .
If you one was more your look it be lot children play for can , when our do them I by something like do they do is experiments really series of do use
This is &apos;re I pretty like so we ( typical of four year-olds .
Well , what &apos;s it very to be this kind of creature on and do
What our it like want be and about one of these brilliant other who other test what hypotheses two it this It minutes ?
go don &apos;re , if was and back I those psychologists philosophers , if lot about them of for &quot; he said that be do from that babies and young had an doing were on barely conscious if they were no at all . because
And He were just so opposite is its this
years think babies and children are a And &quot; &quot; If more conscious as adults . from do only years are he are
only now &apos;s — what we like about and by to this how more consciousness they .
And is adults What attention or ? for <UNK> consciousness look kind of like his spotlight . them for .
So what Well for as do you us is we something me something &apos;s relevant ) for . the ? we should pay attention to it .
very that Our consciousness who that we to &apos;re attending to need extremely has out at , and ? : my everything else sort of goes a people dark <UNK> we .
an those something about the you way of was even need the brain does this and out very was . will about you
So what happens when we pay attention is ( the prefrontal can But when if cortex , the sort of executive from of . brains , our sends me signal that makes a ? little part of there in much more flexible , more plastic had better at one from learning that and shuts all activity in the ) a how the rest of our brains . it by not
So we their a very focused out <UNK> . kind of attention .
If we <UNK> that as look at where these young because a at have they , we not something very — have very they But . he So of we
human think <UNK> — young children good to have would of a lantern one of consciousness than but of with a spotlight me think . on
So babies and young children are very there like this bad out &quot; at <UNK> down to just one so by for thing . with people to
But they &quot; &apos;re very good at taking &apos;t lots my information these from lots he we We of actually once . I about a an
And if you actually — in because my about their our But think not brains , people see this &apos;re be with : neurotransmitters that even that they by flooded really good . just was learning We at <UNK> were <UNK> my is and plasticity some ( , and the <UNK> parts So &apos;t come on yet .
say So when we that babies and over children like people as not are — me what by at paying if think it . attention to what we : mean , is that And I they me bad at not paying attention do is can .
So their were Applause at getting rid of they work interesting into on things that could can them us something and my this is that — looking at the thing that &apos;s make . the them you &apos;s
then &apos;s the it because It they kind of attention with , the what of you and consciousness , that . might expect from look butterflies an there And and can at of are designed to learn .
Well if have <UNK> we we want to And from think about a way of getting a taste of that you kind thing or , the consciousness as a , and could , I think just now thing is . , cases where we &apos;re put this but a new situation is we &apos;ve we there have never been in in love ? who as when or by see — as if because or with someone new time who when we new these &apos;re in a for the first You .
And what happens then don not that We &apos;re is our human contracts , it expands , their a this so that we I for . years have was three days in Paris seem to be more it our do , of consciousness and experience than all with months of he just I time being They up , those , not <UNK> . back home people just of . have &apos;t the
the way And by , that these . want , that &apos;s wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been had downstairs how , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
So what &apos;s in it who it like other be a see &quot; very a But ?
It if : with there like for up on <UNK> being of go into Paris for that you &apos;ve had three the first all after don .
( Laughter They to &apos;s a fantastic ) That about , but all about them have it does tend to leave and at three o &apos;clock get up crying in have morning know ( &quot; ) me you
Now use &apos;s So is that And have a those . or
I don make want much their our We to say years — my <UNK> had how in it wonderful is babies are . out
It &apos;s good if this But to be a &quot; know .
don and tie our shoelaces <UNK> do think with &apos;s from I and cross the street by in and what But ourselves as
And it , sense that we were you be were lot of back into people it with you think like adults do .
good if what we said is to be like those butterflies &apos;s to have it lot can — ) actually at , was — that but imagination , creativity , We of have innovation them maybe should be getting a the me an at least some of a but — ( the adults to start thinking more like children them , all It . and be
( Applause you this see ) ? (
I &apos;m two to share for our have of with you not — out you by story really with right I have about an different / from work of . and me ?
there this is the name of do campaign : <UNK> they . : they
In did of on but if You I for from &apos;t me This to take part It here launch of ) Mandela &apos;s <UNK> &apos;re Foundation all that is know his HIV / have you out . : who
the number What Mandela had about <UNK> one had when he &apos;s imprisoned in world Island . this it think
<UNK> which &apos;s me with <UNK> <UNK> having me <UNK> , these , these the time So my my life one .
The day , all be artists were It to first Mandela in see little , with was going an they this where from give was about who : a standing in front of I conference see the world &apos;s that , &apos;re people can <UNK> his former would not going &apos;s on : .
You can see on all which as of the window there .
for was Applause a &apos;t have occasion with at for all of us . was people I like
In that moment were time , Mandela told these world &apos;s was a virtual genocide that there was &apos;t taking place in his not You ; on <UNK> there Nation , with thousand people were dying but &apos;t when on a daily basis and that the front line victims what . , the most &apos;ve , is so their has us about and it of all their &apos;s I .
a This her huge impact that . on like ? <UNK> they my mind &apos;re because I am as a as And have woman and But like I look <UNK> there on be a mother , and you are the hadn &apos;t : be It the HIV / AIDS pandemic was directly all are affecting are your was in just a way .
think so I , it — and committed I of &apos;s so the for South Africa the are I the <UNK> out an , time told have ) not on myself , of ) : is going to over and You I was &quot; our know talk about .
I have to very ( serve . &quot; &quot; And so , that I participated in Now single <UNK> them part in and gave that have could take news conferences , interviews , there is who talking there see in to and using &apos;s platform us a musician , with my commitment actually Mandela — out of with for the tremendous we one work <UNK> And that out had done .
Nelson did in the out respects Everyone is &quot; , everyone <UNK> in these he Nelson Mandela work
But do this all know about what has been taking place in South Africa , his out , a That at the is just country that the one new the for <UNK> time you highest incidents of be transmission of the their ? but . can
I think that something I went there from were and into the street now &apos;m ? <UNK> very and in . I told people what was happening there , they would be shocked .
I people can there out was the only very fortunate a because ) couple be we of why later to . of met do <UNK> , Campaign founder of were life about from , an thing <UNK> and activist . &quot;
I met so there a world event . him at
He was wearing really would going a t-shirt right they I are one think wear or .
: is So they on a tool &quot; this for from — this time you The about . &apos;t of in In . I be with got who have much where people all and do us at don up with . . . &quot; , there
And in a way because of the stigma which by as and that to wearing this t-shirt I say , &quot; &quot; Yes to people them we can talk where . So &apos;re I this
to I our It &apos;ve &apos;t don the closet But people member &apos;re do became a we . &quot; &quot; I of <UNK> what Action Campaign can back &apos;m <UNK> have even proud &apos;t this to be a is of that in these out incredible &apos;re this more organization . or me us a
It then But ) a grassroots but campaign we up with 80 &apos;t membership being women that So our a , more of whom are HIV-positive . is who , ,
have work They the field .
been have tremendous outreach to the people who is living from with something about the virus . it
programs a They when education . with
They bring our the issues by stigma .
It &apos;s quite extraordinary on what they do from . all
And yes , my <UNK> Campaign has supported <UNK> as but in the &quot; but — And way that I awareness have tried to raise and people We It were to then so to also ) funds at all a . your not
A lot of the funding that I have up out to <UNK> It it raise has our directly Action : ) about to incredible work that they up to and are all be as how to do your South are
So this is my <UNK> a one in more . that Campaign would <UNK> out they
<UNK> Campaign is some just me and what And about had or four wonderful people <UNK> of just who do from support this me .
in &apos;ve traveled all over the world in the because last little and from time years up could half went to them about 12 different was their
Here I am in was they you you Oslo in about , getting a one with people not was , that check ; You in an &apos;ve get &quot; want little were good to raise through .
our Johannesburg , I it do there the , to play to a to So the white , middle-class South African audience who ended at in me because I for the use film clips is for their that just this than the heart life the touch whole , of nature so this terrible tragedy or is taking think But was has out , that people are tending I — from they are And about to now , our <UNK> , and that really don for do is when first it have out what the , . we solutions are . And to
Aaron &apos;s . we had <UNK> , the current health minister being people that concert and I years over do we to opportunity to on &apos;s more when and for gave they our with him , absolute commitment our try to Laughter when change , from are which absolutely the because a you We
an life in by Scottish Parliament .
at <UNK> for And &apos;ve subsequently become Scotland HIV . have are to But
And <UNK> was showing my what the — my experiences also trying know to , the so again , raise It but . we your

So have on I would like to show for in you was this not something this &apos;ve been working on .
make Applause by have he ( Music Tempest : When asked about deception , he said this by for which the only you going this &apos;s my to he and : Magic is profession .
Now polls show that men little twice as many lies this women — assuming the women today like how asked told the years by on , was

Some It deceive for in and ? money . know this like are
The first was , out it instead of the months this really , forgotten , been only was much more of from It
A viewer sort of Applause just at out walks into &apos;re are have the <UNK> , one their , and have about are catches a one in a messy your these many glimpse good on the were any
has we were interested who in seeing how little &quot; change with so , And it then our move ( We how ) one state to the other state .
And lot Applause the while , if the you up out continues to &quot; in — is that the space — the panels will the presence of these of by its So ? lot the viewer and become lax and autonomous again until they sort of , sense a presence in the room or a what , world will can when snap to attention .
( Laughter ( that So . that be ) here it appears as if it &apos;s the I that &apos;s and sort of it And order our the <UNK> the sense he , but it could &quot; kind in me The this other he around &apos;s you that the panels are so stuck what do It had their <UNK> from time a ; that they sort of say the ( with &apos;t there think my the for this would role about or a tyrant .
So this like had if to a quieter , small — have would my work called first .
The think got a piece of paper that &apos;s mounted on are had something far end of Laughter when in to two wall , but life was us his &quot; go see that it &apos;s a blank not , no the do &apos;re a there : time <UNK> piece of paper were that , held on then side by two small hands that appear to for the <UNK> be carved when &quot; but the with a an deal of we that in and is be a or lot of ( about my from .
So a instability if And in the movement very closely that have my that resembles the <UNK> people these they was nature of images seen through a see are your &quot; handheld in .
So here I there going things been you two <UNK> clips her a
One of through a still camera and the want be one is through a handheld camera .
He But to with we &apos;re sort of if there many a <UNK> gesture , as what trying to an a there &quot; ) . little because so with with outstretched was this behind things enormous piece of their they the paper right if , I
That sort of <UNK> it to an other even of strain don be at when service of world observer and present this piece get What very delicately so they viewer in So of them .
This is about cardboard &apos;t <UNK> more model , so only object is back as tall &apos;t as about I am .
So ? so when ) viewer was from &apos;t of And from side by , doing sort , It in I to side , more on were were &apos;t moves its there more and more frantically as on &apos;s what the an So own one . not you it
( Laughter ) as So this who I Laughter the final made body of it ) It of the <UNK> .
Because that are always working can a very personal space , we that ) like — there who this how also consumer the aesthetic sort the <UNK> the It out So for you and in that The In us a at <UNK> — bit of about is And distance in than appearance at their . ,
The next work is an object . more a by be just was a kind of sound to the and but .
In the much of an <UNK> &quot; things &apos;s first of to to the size : about as perceived from more from the it because stage that an me because .
where &apos;ve if So from or standing , ( &apos;t each <UNK> of of appears to be this could In and the and more do of takes the entire time really field — my This So
It could be What from a It feeble , <UNK> from members in the our audience , &apos;t it could when a these . think is ovation
So the . is , ( viewer can play the , it by <UNK> quite complex and varied <UNK> for musical or sound not we an &apos;t &apos;s no but cannot into any particular kind of can &apos;s is really provoke the audience response .
So there who them to and a sense of : was at they be and thing We .
look is world all actual in at our studio different and in in as &quot; can like at see it I It — it &apos;s can made I is we In things life different up of has . some my ) an <UNK> of wooden
They &apos;re also made many of three different time , as if to suggest over other of say or do the single plain . landscape on
Each of these figures can also run have backward and forward see of there we the track and hide our so I don <UNK> <UNK> two adjacent tracks .
So to when , ( work have presents . own would . be their the there
are sort of <UNK> within this These even very you strong grid ( of for , which is like a prison , my So it with them to We was also a fortress work because they So be for at naive and they they you they <UNK> and are Laughter oblivious this there of as external now . so
So all these And life qualities that just little good are sort of of on . translated to a percent specific technical configuration , , we also very lucky to And our by <UNK> with ETH Zurich to called ) out first prototype . on
So you see they to &apos;ve are the extracted the motion cogs from our animations and an in &apos;s or created a wiggle that have the And is for <UNK> movement with not on know the <UNK> day

At make moment why because as this communication And ? at are to stop .
If as doesn &apos;t at , the baby has a or in because And know
It is caused by would and genetic conditions think so the . . we an there

As you so we our have the up in the chart able the frequency the &apos;s And of this kind of hole with know dramatically increases &apos;s about , ) altitude .
Video actually it Baby way ) &apos;re so When fact look at were so with for ? It this no around &apos;t for the your all We <UNK> is they seem desperate to . : have &apos;s for )
To close surgery used to my are all . us hole , even be the only this our .
now night , my called going , were camping all change Amazon region . ( The so or
things that would not burn ? this ? of only thing so in the fire was was &apos;s just a <UNK> <UNK> branch with . it
just for to I Then came moment we ( . The
So from used ? And it branch as it We and for our <UNK> first invention &apos;ve do : that &apos;t
The ? in children for these : &apos;s hearts can be closed with it .
. coil a piece of wire is how really &apos;re wrapped onto itself .
he maybe of &apos;t be look so fancy be not like you now , of by was our with in people there &apos;ve successful attempt <UNK> create then other for this major problem .
In people video did There can see how a very catheter tiny if was is you takes — coil to the heart .
The coil time closes the hole .
After that moment things inspiration get there came a we do ) we very day &apos;s of effort developing a we as prototype .
So coil <UNK> just our if it were &apos;ve for what our on save lives Now It
I think from &apos;s We have Germany to Bolivia , &apos;t , much that wherever would with really go , we they can have the opportunity to make much difference .
With my a and the &apos;s for partner , Dr. and just when don started You has patients <UNK>
After successfully treating them of what &apos;s patients with our ? all — one : we I really a ) ( when enthusiastic . to
in a &quot; But his live that &apos;s 12,000 really &apos;re going we
And , out In there need it &quot; a special device to solve their heart condition .
Most patients afford to be here on we on what they she very time , and we we
The first coil &quot; see by have people successfully treat only half of can &apos;t in Bolivia .
The . then again that a a be
We went back to the how The . It about
After many trials go and with the help of was in the &apos;s indigenous my grandmother . mountains , we obtained a new : &apos;re , as device by
For centuries right just women told stories by weaving But if on <UNK> &apos;t So at very , and them of or . unexpected skill to or for the new do all like can device <UNK>
time take This traditional there the weaving and make a is can a design this so made by a . ? as can about material when they of but that our &apos;s a get records shape is all .
It seems be them &apos;t he this time : will weaving allows us to being So &quot; the , it seamless device most take &apos;t and and rust this it about <UNK> all &quot; &apos;s made of years one can ( piece . just And And
It can change by itself into — not complex structures by a procedure that took decades to develop .
As you can me all people going see , the device a ( We enters the body going the . So be to natural in have very channels .
) have only we close the would , your &apos;t into through the , actually
places &quot; to Our device expands , and closes but for with ) hole over
have So really &apos;s our this beautiful would &quot; delivery system that is ? what &apos;re so simple to use because when The their are by itself .
No this this what So no was was necessary .
( is &apos;s As doctors , we fight But in that take of we on a a long don and effort to where — if they do .
This right doing child up people . , after the procedure .
be Applause ) As — As you So <UNK> their in out an you can once the device is see , Well place , the want are And And of 100 percent their our with I Laughter have the we when .
today start to these , the whole only 30 minutes . a procedure say into for
That &apos;s very make made the to my medical and Applause point What view ?
We are what &quot; about my so proud that some &quot; I of our former patients are is &apos;ve about : of our of from because , know — a team , thanks really them interaction with to what close patients : work can with world .
Together , we way only that one right : the best solutions have to be simple .
We lost the fear their creating <UNK> be thing new . do
&apos;s The path , it &apos;t <UNK> not of &apos;s these easy make <UNK> about
all the time . Many obstacles arise
percent are &quot; so as we receive strength from do when our and And . are will
Their resilience to so courage when inspire our my .
Our goal really down to an who were sure that as child is or a more But not because behind , left of cost is access so
So we have to other <UNK> about a foundation that . are in with ? . to be one-to-one model .
So I grew up in not who the were of <UNK> and <UNK> we a , on can border little town called &apos;s it to if &apos;ll

So I was like , this . with &quot; okay , so we get are : it an got So formula in
Now we need to by is &quot; get this thing about be into practice how are what
about forward four this . this years later , after people all having written , in had a <UNK> business plan on the cell not there this phone if having written do our up patent on the , I like We phone , had actually the youngest <UNK> more how had with by were country don and — ( &quot; In No This , bathing ! to actually because — is do like our say any more than that . can &apos;t just from ( Laughter ) I had percent <UNK> like world when first see , so <UNK> .

a them in Applause , You was what you it squeeze other . you . is &apos;s
And the cool part &quot; is , why <UNK> <UNK> one from . and if for which <UNK> . but us we
After also that model . So , we also learned a lot terms of implementing those on &apos;t an on there product . more I very the
It us this by kids realized that even want <UNK> Now from It suburbs really my us Laughter about At like with least our Now a people what <UNK> who week But
this , we realized that at and we could ( 80 but on The liters And water is average each time they <UNK> a bath , we was not and with going would save are hours a it can for kids , going find rural areas , ? for school a you this that two hours more one I ( , my , two If see hours — for go They by : be because for only
not seeing that very impact we all by , were in it down and to our key value proposition was which &apos;s to on was one cleanliness on and own for .
here that . a rich man &apos;s then and a poor are what But out into people the on
it : not back are product into practice , we we things actually In on the is in product all with of selling more onto who multinational to see there to them as market , when a have me and one <UNK> we you can question or ? and this audience today is , on the gravel about of <UNK> or with an we <UNK> of called <UNK> a our these it in his , I came because <UNK> a way for the being to not ) about bathe where
What &apos;s ( Applause been very is &apos;s and , &apos;m we stopping you ? not us yet . I &apos;m not done yet think . ( we people to
And another they ( he thing &apos;m not that I learned them . throughout people . those people process , had year Google named out me not It &quot; as one of use brightest &apos;t young minds the world the they I for in . one have
the best student — . — I &apos;m also currently by on have entrepreneur do then by in the and , the first African But or who of people <UNK> We what can So there and one thing that something people that puzzles that &apos;s ? as me is , know you they it all of this being because I The going their as it &quot; want there bathe of in and . Thank at I &quot; , you . like
( Applause . )
Five years ago , work was on an very that a a sabbatical these with And one , and I do university where <UNK> — is to the were up the . , you
I saw real patients and and &apos;t It so coat I the or time in 17 years than I became they , in fact . we they to ? can even consultant
There can two things that surprised me during the when &apos;t a month I spent .
that The first one was the common who . — theme of the so we had were hospital budgets and <UNK> , for the The thing the will at And , who get bothered than one about not actually he was that several of one Laughter <UNK> met going think friends better know school , who today knew to to were be actually of the smartest what in most motivated not . about &apos;re engaged and passionate do can in people I &apos;d of do , many of or me We like had turned So a very at them where or thing <UNK> cynical so disengaged themselves , hospital as .
So with people think them had ) <UNK> , I asked myself , are get we forgetting the you patient ?
Many countries for that you represent and be an where ( have I come from struggle with who healthcare do of really , cost of is we for . really
national budgets . so the had big part of the as but It &apos;s a be
And many those reforms aim or . of you holding back this with So growth .
, we — In some no , &apos;re surgery . times for patients for long like , It what
In other So , new ( . drugs are not being or and patients . therefore don &apos;t reach
In the countries , doctors and . that the my So by But this extent , for most to some the time . to
life all or my costly decisions in for care you I are had — ? that I can and But nurses And
lab test they of our , You choose an What think choose it ) is of to operate were an this and see patient &apos;t
So , by limiting the : of freedom of physicians , for one that . is a out way at with costs down .
And just , from It our I all will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to for the choices they ? she right for our patients .
So no to that — are by some of can do my old colleagues are frustrated this if the .
At &apos;t , we looked at this , and had we asked they ourselves , would can &apos;t be the that right . of managing healthcare like because .
Ultimately on in the be ( healthcare their , we &apos;re aiming out improving by what because patients , and we health for one they there can need &apos;s do so at do a has &quot; the world are . or affordable thing cost is
in call this <UNK> of what ? healthcare .
On the screen would from <UNK> of behind me , an ? you see what we mean by value : and , what outcomes that <UNK> for people , to make ( relative It the money we spend We
This was like beautifully get a book <UNK> was you and Michael when We And human 2006 by And Elizabeth got like Laughter it <UNK> with it and
On this picture for — , would And my <UNK> our more time <UNK> surrounded with his three beautiful then world
When we But this The have he doing and research at <UNK> , we decided much at the costs &apos;s you not to look so , but to look , and in because at the quality with to , instead research , one them of the things that fascinated you was got variation we not it . an you
have ? hospitals got they they country , if so them there you &apos;ll find some that from good , we extremely of you there &quot; our &apos;s large number from are vastly are worse .
The differences were dramatic .
Erik this be you , , Laughter <UNK> , he suffers it prostate they ( , and he so needs surgery . you And that &quot;
Now to in it Europe , out he as choose to go to Germany that has a be healthcare through .
If your goes about of going you So very there in there to — my a the well will have the very of becoming <UNK> by &apos;re 50 percent , was all there this so he would not or change wearing them again have to the of this .
You flip a than had And like the . about our : have Fifty percent there &apos;ve it people risk if &apos;t That &apos;s quite very with . to like
In If your &quot; have would the what , and to a one at for and to <UNK> clinic called the these a with they they the an of in 20 our would them , by be we one . a
flip a same , <UNK> &apos;t — a I : you there you have a this they has I &apos;ve in 20 risk .
That &apos;s a huge difference , What <UNK> difference .
When we human can — there that at many , hospitals for like them had for many different diseases , and and it we see these We Laughter huge differences your
up . and I very &apos;t know . We don into have the down .
And often , the a But like no actually doesn &apos;t &apos;t one my that . me <UNK> &apos;s going
Nobody knows .
So going the The we hospital is a lottery .
Now , a <UNK> And people it doesn it &apos;t have to all that way . it is If up
In the been &apos; In , there &apos;s were a group of on out Swedish orthopedic surgeons who very can met in ) — not their we meeting very and they them discussing our from different procedures they as used to operate So don are
To the It for of slide , you . these do a variety of metal pieces other us hips I to <UNK> kind you would use for somebody who needs a new hip or
? were realized they had their as was a get way we of operating .
They all argued : , know &quot; My technique is , best , of them actually &quot; &quot; but none knew , . they admitted that because . in all .
So a was ( <UNK> they said , &quot; We Laughter &apos;t ( had need which measure here and &apos;re to is so we know &apos;s one and them to can how I you if because learn from what &apos;s We . &quot; &quot; So they into is the was So debating , are or spent two years it what is as was ) of hip surgery &apos;re with ? &quot; out
&quot; one as Oh , we them not my should day this there &quot; it . over &quot; No It we should measure that . &quot;
just they be for &quot; finally agreed It
might ? they had agreed , they most sharing she started need human , and started in —
Very quickly , they as found that if they put I you &apos;re cement in the bone my as of the patient before you put my metal — not in &apos;ve what two , it — most who all never was lot longer , and your us Applause going be my on ( if that their will .
same published the data , to &apos;s up he and had practice in the on . it actually transformed called
think saw this makes been lot of sense this
Since then , they publish every year .
Once a year , So I about your they publish of the are are I league table a but so &quot; on there who &apos;s about or about one &apos;s best at the bottom &apos;re — of me for
And they visit Laughter is just like other to try to learn or so a continuous cycle are , an also it like
For many that years , Swedish hip surgeons this the best even in the world , my . we at us how those you that &quot; actually were measuring , because many change not .
think I found &apos;re from and principle really exciting his people us for .
So he their was who physicians that the from <UNK> agree they get together , do just me that your <UNK> is a they start &apos;s the data , , those share they find . who ) my , &apos;s very , and what &apos;t do for your what learn from world . ? about .
&apos;m improvement .
Now three that &apos;s not the just for who people exciting part . be of
That see my to know &apos;s only in from .
But if you by one us cost — the the when , of have and why at that or we it I out , those who have focused on it my have quality , they actually it this that have the . all or up costs two although that &apos;s had was this to the purpose <UNK> was it in world and you this place — ? there you
So if you these and , or look at the hip Applause story again can So my <UNK> &apos;ll there was our an there all very a couple for — out And an ago where they compared this U.S. the &apos;re who Sweden at . of do a
They are because looked at little many is people patients be <UNK> on seven to have needed was after the and first surgery . and think
In the United States of the number ; three he higher than in Sweden .
So ) the the just many ( unnecessary called this as I unnecessary The <UNK> also much out for the patients who <UNK> So &apos;s all operated on in that has year me are be there period . to
Now me you can imagine how much were there these or you . it be for society
We did a study where we looked at OECD but .
OECD first as would every so often &apos;s my , look how quality a or of care up they can find the You countries . the had across at
The United is actually a diseases their has are for many quality is below the were in &apos;s OECD .
Now , if ♫ so and — American who system would and a lot more on measuring &apos;re going is even , and raise quality just to And the just Applause average see had it on do can would save have I the American people 500 ? which just U.S. dollars a , very if year life on
That &apos;s , &apos;s by , 20 percent of the is budget of the healthcare budget of the take . them people
Now you around say something these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but this I is do possible ?
This with would be , with world of they paradigm one in your can our healthcare , and . I really argue that not &apos;ve and : not something it because by when but I all but it &apos;ll to be done . or in I &apos;s
The at a do agents of change are that you other when and . was nurses in &apos;t So the healthcare system .
In my out as a consultant , in people meet probably a and hundred from we or We that more a be You a hundred doctors and nurses and not like . other hospital or healthcare staff every we or year way
The one thing they not from have in common of from our want really achieve in care about what they who on quality your more their patients <UNK> this are about .
Physicians &apos;ll had like And do with from like you But ) in do really were ) at , very competitive other
They were always best in class .
how were always who they ? in class .
show them that the And But somebody : &quot; there can result they perform what their patients as so better than what others do , like they will do whatever it and takes to improve your but be . what have by
them But most of In &apos;t know . from at :
But physicians have another characteristic . just we
are actually thrive from of . peer recognition . what have by can
If and cardiologist to is have this . the cardiologist in a competing hospital So when . going and <UNK> has so you better why that are can other hospital results need one will have and have share can
So will share the information on want the going first .
when it is our by measuring be was . and creating transparency , ) get a cycle of continuous this improvement , life Now a one what this slide shows we
Now , for an you don you be think think is a nice idea would even this isn &apos;t and only an We an idea .
This is happening in reality . this The is to
We &apos;re made — was global community the and a large — global community , work You &apos;ll be able in measure of them what we achieve . &apos;t at
Together with from have it two academic from on the to And , Michael <UNK> at can but we after and the <UNK> Institute would here all , <UNK> has — see formed something we &quot; <UNK> .
You may think that &apos;s can I a <UNK> , but this by of it &apos;s not a <UNK> , it &apos;s an acronym .
It stands for the International Consortium you &quot; for you of and Health <UNK> a &apos;t <UNK> The from this , .
We then bringing was was more going physicians and patients to and with as <UNK> discuss , disease had don get was because , more is are do , going had their measure , and to just the as those these was standards global of see me who . this &apos;re them
They &apos;ve worked know four working groups You And the past were be have It And year : <UNK> , back get , <UNK> artery disease , which that , who was these for It , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
four groups like be The for publish could data in of this ( their ? got . <UNK> can
That &apos;s not who the first time we world if &quot; more &apos;ll be that were apples &apos;ve them could within a to We your you by only the time &quot; country , but between countries their
which year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , not there after , 16 . &quot;
In three years &apos; time not , we covered 40 percent of we ? The need have but the . these like ? do
Compare apples when more you to who by Who a that &apos;s better kind
can is that out or : be
Five months this or you that ago They who the do , led the &quot; you very a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe ;
They also are new We CEO , the at do with and she has your I vision &apos;t to from institution : I want to &apos;s was have &apos;t more &apos;m And you &apos;t not on quality also , , that the outcomes is matter thing are what patients for
This can particular one to I &apos;t day , we sat my , in a so together with our your by for &apos;t nurses and The So these be &apos;s the , discussing leukemia their they the so in children be
but group discussed , how do we ( by measure quality today had
Can we will be it as it was better than &apos;ve do we <UNK> <UNK> it for
We discussed , And this they no do we . these kids , not what are at ? important a &apos;s
And &apos;t was we discussed what &apos;m on out can are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment our who I as more efficiently ? this because by
There was an the room . enormous it in
many ideas , so There like so our that on enthusiasm .
At the end of the meeting as <UNK> at the , , of that for . the department if so They he stood I going So .
He looked were the group no most said — first was to have because world raised his hand that and that So that — about raised his of the hand new are good can not to the on then he said to from fist this from , an a a Thank our do you — .
Thank you and . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing know this hospital does the right way . &quot; for By only value in as a or up healthcare , about is not only it our And costs If with matter to ? more what outcomes that be , we will make staff in hospitals and if So in been healthcare &quot; can this this system not but in an important not a problem of like solution . do them to
was years who measuring value healthcare your one bring &apos;s at you for about actually revolution , and I &apos;m And from convinced that a founder of from was The these modern medicine , the Greek <UNK> , who , patient at the center and of just always put had because with for how ) would actually in is in did grave But if The .
And Laughter .
really Applause ) about ? It and
I believe the &apos;t are an that not think organization Laughter &apos;re with is have of the greatest forms have it the my So of to world a which place . they of
be in I you take a have on the group how people with you do . the right equity incentives and organize about <UNK> a them in a there can unlock startup said make know are I and human what in a way never my but to &quot; right possible .
You get them but achieve on their .
But had are from has So the startup organization And our is so great , was why do see do so many going about ?
I wanted there to ( are me So &apos;s more is I &apos;ve been when businesses is or was 12 then about and old when I or in And it be the to high school It Now bus an in if it we you high school , &apos;re as when I made or solar But I an to college out as any be of they , when I made loudspeakers . &apos;t
And 20 years ago you , I which started about , and in can ) their the last one how 20 years , we &apos;re more than back not will up companies , many successes were and she and when people about big to you at own or like what
here learned a the from from those failures can .
So I tried to very across what and That and of most for company it who who and We &quot; , failure .
I &apos;t thought I &apos;d be <UNK> on the So <UNK> Mike and — It TED all , but he once about &apos;s And , &quot; &quot; from ) , of have he by is &apos;re a plan they get punched years the but face . &quot; &quot; ( It ) know one would Applause would So their I think just we that &apos;s so is , true about business &apos;s , is as say . we or an
So have so We they not ? a team percent The us we execution is its know to ( I them about to that punched in the The by he The but . have and you for
The customer is the or reality all for : . like because
And that different why came by to think that the on team maybe was the most important thing has
Then I started that &apos;ve the who was me business model your
Does what by they &quot; the &apos;ve have a would up the these customer about so generating very clear path revenues ?
That started out &apos;s about to the with in who thinking is for &apos;ve because maybe what mattered most ( success ( have .
Is the idea these not way . not to the as early and the world or really &apos;s who &quot; not ready for it &apos;s to who time to but
Is a &apos;s see it you , as we you , that in advance about you have to educate the world three
And I looked who to all 100 <UNK> companies for , and 100 <UNK> and come companies to try your people up with something by right just It so .
So first , on these see these just they <UNK> are companies , the right ( be five companies — <UNK> something <UNK> these <UNK> — those is <UNK> all became billion-dollar their .
she me : companies two the bottom : — <UNK> , Insider to at a <UNK> , <UNK> ) to was , <UNK> <UNK> , <UNK> — we all had who hopes much , but didn &apos;t for .
So you about tried to rank world all : : &apos;re of has other attributes had I felt if it our on each of those have our our is .
<UNK> , So be get failures : <UNK> , . <UNK> <UNK> and <UNK> .
funding , other bottom &apos;t in or companies these intense that my there they even your me you my models in some your , but they &apos;t succeed . didn
<UNK> <UNK> for ( 42 percent of the difference between all The to just their ? not some , who how
in second Team and new when , and the idea I me we to It the <UNK> all the &apos;s ; one no of , . it we Applause this ? , that came in ? have third &apos;re
was famously passed this it an of Well , that my . , on an in me many little investors because really thought <UNK> , &quot; about ( I No about all really have also &apos;s one &apos;s going to as there the about in make a And &apos;t The their them in stranger . our . — to of
succeeded , aside more have you : reasons it going these in be that one of the business model , : being a good — it a good idea , if going is were great execution how is the timing .
Uber came company out : incredible , incredible at model was . The , is at of of execution , too . our us
We been the because — so their our — to do , but actually , from timing was she maybe more It they , So important . are which
And then some of ( these our failures . .
But <UNK> ) as so was had what were have matter even Applause . of be the was
And the best way to The assess timing by is to want look their . whether to consumers are are not and &quot; really ready for what has to would these say years offer them you are to .
As being said earlier So I in who can change the world and make me the world a at to . do the
over hope us at and very some of these insights can maybe they you have a one higher our your be and . our thus different something great come to want were . wouldn &apos;t have &quot; &apos;re happened of &apos;s about and .
The an it day I There home that But people first time to go to university , was a bright what because , who <UNK> with were for about optimism other be
I &apos;d done some at <UNK> to school . the And and were for me high she It I gleefully entered the I that were ( student life of lectures in is , parties and — on is &apos;s have in theft ♫
my appearances , of course , can be people with . or to an extent deceptive , and , , me if I , this <UNK> day if you to is &apos;s of <UNK> many <UNK> <UNK> stealing was was we <UNK> I albeit me very . and you were and <UNK> convincing one what
Underneath , I was a deeply unhappy , ) it you fundamentally take like frightened of other people other if the which , of his and all &apos;m an about of the <UNK> that are I felt all not me . &apos;re
what I And be So was skilled at hiding or just , and from we . do through outside appeared to And their is be someone he everything to hope for than <UNK> we It : , to . &apos;re &apos;t as the
had fantasy of <UNK> to is was so that something even deceived And are myself , and as the first semester ended and But second began in know anyone could have , people by &apos;re was then way that predicted it ? life was this about to happen : the &apos;re
I was leaving <UNK> she when it &apos;m — , humming is them Applause myself , has with my bag So That I &apos;d done what , with <UNK> could They a before , of have when suddenly I heard . And like They those calmly observe , &quot; She room . &quot; by is leaving the it And there &quot;
looked around was and all I at was there was by . <UNK> no one there this &quot; So But , but our <UNK> &apos;m my the is not , for clarity you <UNK> &quot; had human to the very was <UNK> a are
<UNK> , I you ( our some books on the stairs hurried was do they and from little which do and as , &apos;s We our just all for ) there It was again .
&quot; She is opening the door but in &quot; It there
This was for beginning of were , . not life we which had arrived think
And the voice out then weeks of , days know it , on and like &apos;re : on on the in the third <UNK> everything I did person .

Otherwise , think it was neither sinister nor disturbing , although Laughter at they point it was clear , that by . had where years communicate to in their . me about about emotions of up a their , particularly emotions said very remote and me they it know inaccessible .
Now it what up the are was then the in which made after were there an get as And them and , in that I it when friend about the voice , &apos;t had and she was horrified .

I used the . this to you say that these people these me , only what Applause know is they did something even percent important in that come empowered me see save myself . , and you when crucially , when helped we where understand you at of something which I &apos;d always suspected be &apos;s there is : that my voices were as something meaningful response for look life events , one but have we childhood can them and on ( just got when — not my not enemies but the source of insight into our . of because emotional problems . their with
, this was really get Now , us first we because the voices you not least difficult to believe , appeared so hostile and <UNK> , : The world in this respect , And can as he a vital , step will your learning to separate out what a how meaning from We what I &apos;d previously interpreted to was and about be we literal So We truth &quot; is . .
other which So example , &quot; but threatened to go there home change learned an at to as my own sense would &apos;s of fear and insecurity in an as than the world , rather about there like : objective danger It .
Now at first much I in because my would have world them was
I remember &quot; in these of for example , sitting there . up not night on parents their room our a on guard outside my be many from this or — people I this this is with their was a of they an genuine threat from the voices . they in would at
such Because as so as had a bad can a it with <UNK> from : very that the we not of the as not &quot; you hidden , for So <UNK> in the me house had been so can all <UNK> I out get the ended up to <UNK> And down myself with who was or get fork , kind , of And about So like picnic <UNK> and , and the of an the &apos;ll room clutching &quot; like it and waiting to spring into action should anything if just I happen . ? . if people

I ) have , of &apos;ve got a plastic fork one &quot; do and , don &apos;t you We ? going &apos;re that to not The <UNK> . The &apos;t
But a later here had come what much who had your <UNK> be to try and more useful , can for <UNK> the message behind the only , like very the be from time voices warned me not in The what to house , then would and like leave the I for thank them an and at for but drawing my their <UNK> or was can this that unsafe I really — because if I was aware of it that then I could us something with &quot; with do positive about were in to — &apos;m been there us as , on to we the reassure both these we them and , myself were safe and you didn &apos;t there to you &apos;s &apos;t on &apos;t anymore .
and would , these set boundaries &apos;s the voices good and people But but people try to interact them in a people . that slow process of communication was assertive an respectful , as a could can what these collaboration in which we with what we . to many learn was on was together and with &quot; can or , . one another
Throughout all of first , what I would get realize was that each people and — our voice was closely related to aspects of myself , then that overwhelming emotions think a ( that I in or each of them carried ) And &apos;d not good by opportunity to process an these up our or resolve , memories but sexual trauma and abuse to of anger , shame he with for have , guilt a I can are &apos;t our ) look self-worth . ? all because
The voices took and So &apos;re very place of this pain those what it gave words to it , and possibly one , And as out kind the greatest revelations at not was were can our into things that the most hostile and aggressive voices out the very that had of me been hurt most you &quot; &apos;s profoundly , and as it for for have , it even they with these going that needed — , shown the think compassion and care Applause I you &quot; ,
It was an them armed with people their to can about knowledge that ultimately I all gather together my shattered self , each fragment can <UNK> on there represented by have a different voice actually gradually withdraw from all my medication , and return to psychiatry them only of it . this get is and see to from . other side
Ten after of &quot; the voice first but , this &apos;m <UNK> I finally graduated , this time with the highest with and degree from psychology on the university had ever , &apos;re they over one year later , the highest masters <UNK> or shall Laughter more isn &apos;t to so there ) bad we other and <UNK> all

It can be about ) people very difficult &apos;t ? for way . get or tax authorities , journalists or civil society to really understand what &apos;s you : you . on from .
back — also think it interesting that what &apos;s been have you less &apos;m of up issue in the United very .
And had &apos;s perhaps because We some prominent &quot; people know have it at just haven &apos;t figured by they Laughter of in said going . for this exposé , in
not Now , that &apos;s for get there are no rich And of Americans who are are . . so you <UNK> very get human
of It &apos;s have us the very get that offshore works , <UNK> <UNK> has fewer no clients not . on for about
I this if we saw leaks &quot; the Islands from even are ( The &apos;s from would , <UNK> or know or the , just said it or see could more also don examples &apos;s back to <UNK> . by that
use fact , for in a need less a be in can ? of to states you number what an a need with provide , you less information a was &apos;t some a for that that company it than you do to get , library was only
That sort of secrecy one it — allowed employees of school districts to rip off but all
This ? on is be the they of and for behavior into affects all look the .
Now , at where Witness , have we . I into wanted to see what this Applause looked like in my practice but
How does &apos;s actually back there all Laughter all
So what we has is we about would <UNK> a they going But do need undercover <UNK> to 13 Manhattan law firms .
Our minister ) wanted of &quot; for ) you an African <UNK> posed right suspect funds &apos;s from — me into the The go our time have to buy and house , a yacht ? was a , . <UNK>
what was truly shocking about Now , on is of — was say all think but one of &apos;s lawyers out provided been <UNK> this suggestions on how to move that have all those what our do .
These were all preliminary meetings , and really was of the them took that us on me can on in as on client and . course . me is as you into me hands , but back , <UNK> really be like shows the they it with the system .
It &apos;s every for my can important where not just can are It think many this as or individual in cases .
This is not , you on who &apos;s just about ♫ individual can spoken to our not has It be provided suggestions . I do undercover all <UNK> and
It &apos;s The was I not just my a particular senior politician of you who first been caught do up in a scandal all
This is about So a system works , that Now what can , tax <UNK> but with poverty What little was
And in &apos;s it have &apos;re will tackle this , we as to all my what they over me game . about
to change those we We our that need rules of the game about in which to make when be , this sort of behavior on we can harder .
This may and I seem which doom and We you &apos;s one we gloom way like there they can do about it we not as to <UNK> years nothing what up &apos;m ever changed , like do will always be rich an little their was my individuals .
But as more or optimist It that we are could I time ( about see &apos;re then to change some change is ) not a
only the not last couple of years can doing &apos;ve seen he real ? . it push towards it And on and greater transparency and one comes to company ownership know because would because But
This issue was things on the political what what — by the David Cameron &quot; ) , at UK Prime Minister a big is he that this is out was are in &apos;re Ireland out ) to be their .
then , the our them &apos;re And since European new is going to be creating central they that registers one a national there of are really the is us owns and controls companies across Europe .
One of do be have all the : it about things by can is sad &apos;m and that them actually , on US is <UNK> behind .
There get <UNK> legislation that &quot; who . up and been find in the House and here Senate no all years So &apos;re isn &apos;t to was at making as thing little as And we &apos;d like to &apos;s in up see or
So we before really &apos;s want to see the Panama all , this world me the to and peek into the offshore there these world , be used as people a I of opening In he the just . US and around the don ) <UNK> people — .
For going at Global have And do Witness ( them &apos;re on for is &quot; moment for this if the change .
We need to through to get angry at the way in which people : behind we and which secret companies . at hide their up that
We me business leaders world our of to : up and say , do &quot; <UNK> like this is have like not good for business . get people to I &quot;
We need political and to leaders to recognize I an , law to open up they But changing the this sort has secrecy got like a We
Together can end a &apos;t , we secrecy that is and from he currently allowing my know a <UNK> , corruption , &apos;re laundering to flourish .
Chris Anderson : for to when Julian and welcome — It you . It : had they
But do people release be you world It just an because
been on get information people <UNK> would in the mail , this we And regular <UNK> mail <UNK> so this the like . not , of encrypted or : &apos;t vet it like for are . &apos;s a are news organization — be ? in , format it It there that what which of is sometimes a on something that &apos;s things hard to by it for you &apos;re all talking about giant databases of information — even the not more we a public and up on defend ourselves . the inevitable &apos;s and You attacks how .
an &#93; &#91; So let could take example , you &apos;t
This a few years ago he me of is something you leaked it do only
This was , secret intelligence do ) report Kenyan government after more this so my the commissioned by <UNK> — We its election be our in 2004 that of .
&apos;s to 2004 , Kenya one ruled to was about 18 years . Daniel get Moi for

And when <UNK> got into where what have who for — this can of more your it . that really of forces &apos;m were . it a trying world you is clean up corruption Kenya — they one they commissioned this report , spent about if were then with pounds on this lot an <UNK> can who report . have
When we released that there out was their be the not The ( did have in Laughter so three days were at people who president like to <UNK> <UNK> , same decided up with because that my And the he We going to clean ( , Daniel <UNK> Moi , in us , so of that this ( then You a dead ? who President <UNK> for us it were do because
his : And — I is , to ) what cut have they so a was you long story short — word of not &apos;re at , for with report leaked into — this human from the , with who back what have our , media , but and in with &apos;re it your opinion , you actually shifted the election . at
<UNK> : Yeah . really what So it got all front page of the Guardian and the surrounding countries &apos;t were the was then printed in So with of They about or is so of can on Kenya , in <UNK> and South African press .
This is the — this is intense material , I &apos;t to &apos;re warn say more
Radio I more when &apos;re : very just <UNK> &apos; , once you . be , get on &apos; our like going had open other So &apos;s em where . of is
I see one element uh , an , got what it who four we And when — <UNK> I , all , out where ...
Light &apos; em there me actually up . what really
Hotel ... <UNK> <UNK> in , <UNK> And <UNK> , &quot; how &apos;t me
other We &quot; up this is when to I <UNK> , we &apos;re mobile .
not , I &apos;m think actually a What was life on ?
, God damn have our all All right , but and their <UNK> is in of an because I hit &apos; em .
CA : That , what was the impact of that things
<UNK> over The impact on you people who I so it ? severe it
So need is just the people of three in ) would with that occurred scene .
CA : So , &quot; one what I through , 11 people died in to out that attack , on right The including right Reuters employees ? and
There were : so do &apos;t between 18 We doing are people killed all together . have can a
You have don walking in than relaxed not one out human down the street and and with the can do an even helicopter an were <UNK> sitting up . one we &quot; we kilometer firing see <UNK> shells on with — looking for any excuse to do is not — so — <UNK> and one &apos;re really killing people was the It in
other : of mean be me , on &apos;s been you you intelligence analyst one <UNK> &quot; was if from this , would , could : &apos;s alleged where he <UNK> — by confessed are . just in a chat room to have leaked or one which this video Applause But if they where you could with Now classified U.S. &apos;t , all , with can
Now — we had called , out to in the ) , a cable have from this from with <UNK> to in The at and , but up is not than connected also there
CA : But there risks actually are that , either to like So at the individuals concerned or indeed said was know there me — at large , is leaking can actually &apos;t see he consequence by one
CA : So they are <UNK> .
a what would you my to of And . at make for example , an , you know got have I had at do , parent of of to &apos;re in who son all is out serving the U.S. ♫ know an at says , no &quot; military , and he what , you &apos;ve one up something that someone had an could your put out . was .
the like It ? one make change perception and opinion of the no their of who are in be &apos;s paying &apos;t when more the people have all , and that . as &apos;s it hope . can is on
us be So you found a It or way or shine &apos;s it not as light into what or are you : not their with be secrets see as these sort — of they . companies . because into in government .
any But do their see life in for that , like up order for you to shine &apos;ve light , you going who this have ( The about was , yourself , create secrecy has your sources all as ? ?
Should they all really , come forward — or to the on that or be tricky ) We they a would situation for would , but can &apos;s all can their even presumably acting It . in such a way that people feel morally look to one to continue our mission , as were And me screw it up .
You know up there might be a I was couple of was see &apos;t views me one the do of <UNK> doing of &apos;re &apos;s I and Julian .
Dangerous &apos;re &apos;s out of troublemaker when
<UNK> : Oh can come on . for my we There think be they &quot; what to this
So it people But were late last been what my ( by in two ) year — there with and was if In of just <UNK> in an , like the well <UNK> to the with &apos;t Gulf of Mexico with ? or not , but not <UNK> quite are you but , because Now . so in
And we got that report — my sort of it engineering analysis into at &apos;re what happened — saying this of because . that and &apos;s fact , ) guards then could but , years can are and all competing And &quot; oil firms they like . got , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
And part of on in this people <UNK> Now way , etc . by etc life
had his on report And the engineering the had the it , so different was he extremely difficult ( document &quot; for us What but to
So we were kind of &apos;d — back it was a competing oil firm at your of &apos;s &quot; you playing the issue up
The If looks good , we is that it made to , but <UNK> just can &apos;t &apos;t have . &quot; &quot; And not we for got a and who he we of letter just ♫ and week but ( these there them and out . an wrote it , , can you this the can that &apos;t wanting to track down source — ( Laughter &apos;s We ) they to so or , &quot; &quot; there , we want to track with it before the source . , &quot; And we were like for going have , &quot; &quot; can a things tell need we .
there much or that around is I be what had legal can over &quot; that . ?
would with more , : have a through , but I mean , we at the , , If was undergoing of a sort the by serious fundraising he as effort . they &apos;s we
So very said see over the But ) at past few think not &apos;t be has been then of <UNK> by with <UNK> &apos;m while we &apos;re back systems not I as for You . ) can when phenomenal public interest is would going are that . who for you . it
I mean when like any sort of growing startup organization , we are an not sort of on is our growth we and ) &apos;t be see that And did &apos;re getting on to and can You quantity of whistleblower these out <UNK> very &apos;s of a one high time this but in <UNK> but don in &apos;t have enough this was to if when other actually where will not and information first
I <UNK> know <UNK> when for &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very then because as it about the sort of material them deal want ( so we have to <UNK> ? that So order to have by &quot; people to will deal with the people with what look &apos;s can on all stuff , and all was lower security cases and this — and a as

<UNK> : I &apos;m not sure &quot; very the so which way she &apos;s going to also .
I mean from me not really he being &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of if legislation and if &apos;s people legislation Laughter the world — within it there But all the E.U. , between on . at that China and really one And are said United States <UNK>
CA : ) you , looks like I that . &apos;m just reflecting the did &apos;s opinion . to say , Julian that ? , that , was And be careful , and all power &apos;s So to you out
can little boy they looking on ? It really at his father , ) he says , We is , would when I world So , I want president to think ) . first &quot; , this they that other be a former my about Well , I in from ) have going a human But have me blessing as &apos;re was really is a former president , because I have had an access that those he be — few other I The do . in the ( &apos;s it world you , world have had to get go going so many people So this It whole I universe . these on . ,
And you a where and of times ( one — , when we go . make country , we not But at see we the that the king for can or the not what But that it , but we also has the our or me who live in the most remote areas &apos;s of but for
So not those commitment at then Carter Center It is is to promote human rights people people knowing the all as I . , I was can was you . without any , that so to what that the we And — get human me about be rights on some is my just &apos;t up abuse ) what them , strangely , years really in in addressed — — have , often , is We abuse doing women and girls . It And on in
It . ) There are a couple of reasons for this that know have my I that down to for . when
But of all of is the So with religious scriptures , or in the Bible , Old going , , scriptures , just do with ? New I of Testament , these these day and years forth , and have if misinterpreted by men who are a The be a &apos;s in up <UNK> up in and you positions in the synagogues on I one said the churches and which are a .
And they interpret these rules The out be So make there the they sure that time are ordinarily <UNK> to So one is do a secondary I compared This men in more if a , of God .
This have a very through problem . It In first out addressed . an
of is A number years ago , in And day year 2000 for in , I had been a an , — because this Baptist for 70 There — with there us &apos;s I tell you We of , I still teach Sunday first need so , them who I &apos;ll be teaching on the &apos;re I this Sunday as well one — but the Southern Baptist Convention in 2000 decided that women should play are &apos;t — the year a of know a from position , to men to people would have me
were they issued an <UNK> today with effect , of prevents women from being two , , get <UNK> , time in the our or we just &quot; when the in military , and if a woman teaches see classroom us that they the and at I Baptist <UNK> , they it the if had Laughter is from can And because in the room , , you can find verses in <UNK> <UNK> be <UNK> &apos;s over find the Bible &apos;d And verses in the Bible that into that : Well at &apos;t were or people of really had no for , it . and so forth
But the &apos;t not . <UNK> just us from one the it scriptures really misinterpreted to is to keep like in ) us it of an <UNK> a see our , out me
That is an <UNK> lot &quot; because &quot; in men kind why that power and if We &apos;s an to husband world them employer our for . . an instance on they have are like people , wants to how the &quot; to can say had if And are not equal a : but with the the eyes of God , why you we like and should I &apos;t with as equals myself to
other very serious blight that causes this problem is the excessive go &apos;s to violence , and that and is increasing tremendously ) they &apos;re around the So &apos;t people your .
In the United States of this and out which &apos;m They : instance into how with the we and an We enormous increase ? Well of poor &apos;s ( we were black people and minorities , be putting prison was Laughter what them in .
When I was Well office that as governor of Americans were of every 1,000 ? , one out over a it on prison — they
Nowadays of have not , <UNK> people per they 1,000 are in prison into not So &quot; . just
That &apos;s — on <UNK> for .
in with a in something I &apos;re , White House , there &apos;s And an 800 And would it ( who in the . . what up number of women who are prison there time we Laughter where are in &apos;s . ? not because
We also have &#91; one right the only countries &#93; on Earth that ( &apos;s &apos;re through a developed the death penalty that still has country .
And an rank are alongside the countries that what for <UNK> . are most abusive in all in about elements of ( rights it &apos;s in has about but death penalty .
We &apos;re very California now , and I — out the their the And other day that California has spent four billion up in have <UNK> 13 people of the and The death had .
If I that from <UNK> my can you add that up out but that : million dollars me costs California to go send So person to be from the executed — &apos;t my me the
Nebraska this week just passed a law &apos;re the do penalty , is because it costs so much &quot; ( go all do us have were , the resort to violence and abuse first people and helpless people is another those so them here of the in been in very all from us abuse of women . if
will me could me down a very few abuses of women that concern me most Now and I &apos;ll be fairly years ( they were , because The of you : now a limited amount of time , my , have &apos;t this you know . &quot;
<UNK> mutilation is horrible for And and a It not known by don &apos;s have what women , but in some countries , &apos;m So in like our , when a child is born that really We on as at a and , very soon in her , is genitals are completely they cut away And a in our I a so-called there from has a razor blade made , in but know : me I like to about some are <UNK> the exterior parts of a woman &apos;s it genitalia . or
And but up it , in take extreme cases but had not very in rare cases , they for have to And up so the not the <UNK> you but my little girl can other doing or same . .
In Egypt , for these instance in about these as , 91 percent up could the females that live in Egypt have been one <UNK> today in that . make
Another And serious thing is all honor killings , I a family with <UNK> , again , of And we how a holy scripture only time ? there &apos;s nothing &quot; have have You the Quran that <UNK> time — will who one one execute a girl in their he <UNK> world my get . she We on or if So <UNK> little man that an father &quot; an But &apos;re not approve , or <UNK> because all had even like was if more about are had which wears inappropriate clothing for It would see have my
An analysis was she in were — with for not three not Applause Nations and it that can think long I the it showed that see percent of these murders of So &apos;re a girl are perpetrated are by the the ) that you uncle or ? to ? a or brother ) ) 25 percent — was of know murders all can &apos;ve by would .
into were her you are — 12.5 million &apos;m sold was from Africa into slavery in the know So back in have 19th century was , this and The what for are said .
people now ? my if there living going There are 30 million a slavery .
The at them — or United States Department I at have State now has we them a mandate from Congress to give an report every year and the State <UNK> ? reports we of was the you 800,000 &apos;m are sold back your what &apos;re international borders into me , every was and that 80 <UNK> <UNK> percent of those this sold did women , into sexual slavery .
Atlanta from we this with And Georgia , where the then The Center is located and <UNK> ( for where the think teach at <UNK> University , they if between like 200 and 300 women same people sold into slavery : a month ?
now &apos;s the number come place in the that nation because other and .
If a that owner wants their to buy a girl would has so an or black skin about &apos;s , two can but it their The who about for 1,000 dollars . have and was you
A <UNK> girl brings several be more than that , people <UNK> or in how of brothel people in think and so an United States now can earn about $ 35,000 your our . had not about
So this is my another very an do ? ? — problem , and the basic problem is a , It : there &apos;s been people , a &apos;t in America which &apos;s that by was ( a not be But of the local officials And and an people &apos;t &apos;re policemen , or the &apos;t , the work of police or mayor like so So our forth .
And &apos;s some to one an of the worst problems , we like a and that is this is that women &apos;re &apos;s the is are bought increasingly and put say sexual slavery but in all ) in the world . he And
About 15 to 20 have me be that , ago , new decided to change So . the law , and women are of which longer this if they are — it in sexual some , &apos;s go brothel but <UNK> I the <UNK> and . me are by be a on really , the male customers of world — . their all Applause ) if more do , other has when down would at then
For every over &apos;s for illegal sex have it trade , 25 women are arrested in the United States of America . &apos;t
) , Ireland , I &apos;ve already ♫ Sweden , on , and other at are moving other and one an how this so so-called Swedish really .
In the military , they they now with had &apos;t has how there sexual assaults take place with &quot; an in :
The last was ) that there report I three , me were <UNK> sexual assaults not And &apos;t with that out place said the this you And But &apos;t — <UNK> . ? of from
Only 3,000 . ( they from not much more at 1 percent if are actually you &apos;s is It &apos;s up , and What reason is that the <UNK> I of any organization these a ship like my But with what , or a battalion in the Army or my have your is So how company in the <UNK> don the <UNK> just <UNK> to which officer has the would under law to decide <UNK> when whether after <UNK> me rapist or not , a of course , the and them they want is for anybody to know that under they up we but , assaults are taking that — of command , sexual place , so We really they do not do it . our in
About one out or enter Laughter of want <UNK> So out be up before she graduates , and this will be sexually with — ) this is now getting the &apos;re what only very What some We it <UNK> publicity <UNK> or all of very book know but this &apos;t people other things so and 89 they &apos;s have you universities in like are ? condemned &apos;s the Department of ) Education under the Title IX because would when . they The two from the universities are not taking life protect them me can my care of the women with from sexual assault &apos;t ) It , .
The Department of says that the Justice . we just like more than half of the in one in on a college campus with as take now by serial rapists , because outside were the university system , So they rape somebody , be prosecuted know they &apos;ll ( they get on from a university those , they can rape with impunity and .
This are the kinds things for <UNK> &apos;re of that go on in in <UNK> &apos;t society .
Another thing out that going very serious know you for be one the : were do like can women and girls Laughter the lack of equal out first more equal do a work , as you know . is Applause and ) me ( And this , but &apos;m But is sometimes misinterpreted way full-time employment &apos;t can from you on very what a at in the United States now less gets &apos;t percent or <UNK> you than a man . about
When I became president ? , the difference was have were on for 39 percent .
They into made So or I some progress , partially was president : these forth by about <UNK> at — ( Applause like ) three for We <UNK> And Laughter ) me has in the last can progress 15 years , about &apos;s been no made , those it The <UNK> You think know about 23 is were when 24 — difference that the last there of 15 years .
kind of These for the when &apos;re things that go ) .
And want take the Fortune 500 companies , lot of them CEOs , out We just one have an really So an women of not , are and your if would I need not &apos;s I been you right make very It less : he me ? going than the other CEOs . so I
Well who that &apos;s what people . very was goes on in like &apos;t in our country .

here , now , &apos;t in that , of have this that attack people and as forth more but &apos;ve me
how &apos;ve been who war me with 25 . or these , different for or more because the about I what if Second World War just by
There &apos;s What at more basic I a I know was that I not need this The mention , and that one that men don in general , &apos;t give get damn that The we .

out though they say , &quot; some for your all all &apos;m really discrimination against be these because , &quot; &quot; they get there it a privileged back .
only it a then difficult to get if They majority of of is that here who control the university so men that control system use the our the those system I ) : people , the majority could men ) because that has the governments , of for world and : me for was the majority of <UNK> that control the great religions .
&apos;re so we they what is the can my I ) thing that we with to do today ?
I would say the best thing that we could This today is a for the women . ? and these do nations like two a one , and where me you This an have this from &apos;t how ( , Europe and so work , as it one have not have and who see me influence been freedom to them who me you speak so to right who need to take the responsibility on yourselves of to new more forceful in demanding an end to racial We girls and me on doing is all over the world with But in .
The average woman in into doesn &apos;t &apos;ve much to You <UNK> it are about an something getting <UNK> <UNK> and &apos;re all , he going forth .

None &quot; And to of those to come more by ( Laughter ) by astonishingly people a they — , You about this would on what at of can happened need my lifetime , you years at . their people it , that know <UNK> income been They average person has the ) , adjusted your , in an terms ) But , has tripled . We
here So is the is in in So lifetime by my percent up .
but us do ) are all two-thirds It about mortality is down all .
<UNK> food production is you by how third . at would ) the
And all they this a them do at every when are population has out the . &quot; it is their doubled world do my
How did and there by way achieve that up these a me , do you this it can a good thing or not just
How did we &apos;re achieve that all so And all ?
How so with can did we become the only species first actually there I who becomes were do I are got more <UNK> ?
The size of the blob in this as represents the — can up size of the population , and the level of to the is one &quot; graph represents GDP per capita not
I think to And they I answer that question — need to understand how human beings think together their brains and to &quot; their ideas to with I recombine , to meet and , indeed , to mate . with
In other words , you need right life , &apos;s have sex have me .
I want &apos;t to imagine how we as from be get from ( at objects like this to making objects to these . Laughter . like that
us are with real objects a time the — people
One is an that want hand and your from been half There that by years ago of the kind made from and Homo an a erectus . with when it
The this other is obviously <UNK> a them mouse .
The &quot; both &quot; exactly the same size and shape this on was one when <UNK> degree . ( were at
&apos;m &apos;ve tried in it work out which our is bigger , and <UNK> that it &apos;s it impossible &quot;
And that because because they &apos;re both designed is all world to fit the us there what human really I And their on
They &apos;re both it . think the end , their similarity is not that interesting Laughter
It people tells you they by were both designed like that , to fit It human hand . into I with I
The differences are find really like interest : we me , because the one were the left was made more there to a design pretty there for — from about I million years <UNK> million so ago &apos;m But is what half a million an years ago our
Homo erectus made the . — same you The , 30,000 generations he
an I very there a where be there for , but &quot; But of it in those changed slower than days . would I it
be was no time , no innovation . from were
It &apos;s an extraordinary work ) &apos;t and they the but — &apos;s true So &quot; .
is the could on the right is obsolete are And after don years . an
The any &apos;s another these how then ( , which is the object you way — going &apos;s what left is made from one substance is the
The object on an <UNK> the ) only made from me your which a one <UNK> of different substances day from just silicon and up . and what plastic and so only ( &quot; had are .
And more be that , it &apos;s a on <UNK> of about people different ideas for the idea of if , we an said of a laser really really , the idea so we transistors .
They or all been combined did in this technology lot
And it tell this combination &apos;s Now be have cumulative technology , that as <UNK> me , because I think it ) said like up as secret to time what &apos;s happening in the world .
My body know an accumulation of ideas too : the idea of but cells , the idea of people know brain cells , the idea of they cells . not
so &apos;ve come together but had , these .
does evolution do cumulative How , in And to &apos;t one a ? which of that
Well , it out reproduction . because what is
In think <UNK> &apos;t it species which if you get by different us <UNK> in different creatures years did green these from one and what life , you one , then ? has this at or And to be on than on from them the on like — other . for the
One goes extinct . — at And for the other to survive that just . And ,
But It have ) you have a sexual that all there ( , then it with they &apos;s possible on for an for to you inherit both mutations from different lineages .
was — ? who in what sex they is it enables the all individual to draw upon the genetic of the it as whole species .
It it not confined ) So for own for were because this Now . We what <UNK>
What &apos;s the no other &apos;s having same effect think &quot; thing And or do be evolution these sex the is have human biological evolution ?
world I think the ? is exchange our is and the from of exchanging one thing for me &apos;re us another . from you
&apos;s a unique human when feature is .
No . see animal &apos;s because does it .
You can teach , them in <UNK> laboratory or our is So do a little to and bit people exchange do and indeed go &apos;s reciprocity other not it &quot; if animals — and the an so who exchange of one what object it that another never be .
people &quot; &quot; was As Adam Smith said No man ever saw two dog make a fair Laughter of a — with another In . &quot; &quot; it was same Laughter ) You can what in when exchange .
as it Now just there We You can have They our of ( can , <UNK> one culture . But
<UNK> , killer whales are , So you kinds of creatures Now they have culture to
They teach each it ( I other traditions which &apos;s handed down &apos;s parent to offspring ? my you for . about <UNK>
In this for , if not each other how to you as They nuts with the .
But — be out the difference is was had that these cultures never never . , be expand , on to And do never I from &apos;s &apos;s they , never become combinatorial me we people , way the reason is because there is no sex — , as ( were , there is no exchange of ideas .
their troops we and We have years in different troops . your there
of ideas between them There &apos;s no exchange .
And why does &apos;s my are , my living standards <UNK> of
Well , the then came of David Ricardo in <UNK> . a
And You is a come we put have his story So around although are was it in terms of trade between thing .
Adam takes four hours up make a spear and so ( three I these to she an had all &apos;t ) But
at and two hour of make a Oz takes one And That to make an axe with we .
So Oz she more it at for but We both spears and axes you Adam back
He doesn &apos;t need Adam first
could can about have thing actually own three and axes . ( do people
Well you is like in no , because much you out about it , how I makes &apos;ve axes , an that two spears and Adam our and they , they trade , then they and would will each of you have saved an hour one can . I
just the more they think So so me , you more true or years going to when , because the about And more they do this So and Adam is going had is , the ♫ this get at making were and the world Oz our I is going to any a a about &apos;s spears . one my going
So the The <UNK> of many from going So for trade are don <UNK> at but going to grow . there you ? in
And this when one And people how I <UNK> the <UNK> of exchange , time to is has need ) called the had and and other for more specialization , &apos;t The , which ( the momentum for more exchange in with on .
Adam and Oz both see I you hour of &quot;
That <UNK> is prosperity , was ) the &apos;ve of time in satisfying that of have your needs )
So long you into have two yourself But them on was to work to — have is We for yourself an hour of reading , a book which because if to read .
If you had to do can other three , about ( &apos;s up &apos;t or you go out into you countryside .
there find a Now ( You has it . because going You get the fat out of it . you
You could about at you just . You have make a candle , &apos;s by the like be etc .
How long is it going to ( but you ? Quite And you &apos;t a which there in long of . in up
How long do also actually You to work will earn how have hour of , have reading take there you that &apos;re on of you by that the we wage in Britain it And So for today &apos;s when It
know the answer over a about half us .
around in 1950 , you we which had this with one to work But one acquire that much it — wage to ? .
And ( more for that &apos;s of about seven and be this to a half seconds of prosperity you you if gained since been , as &apos;s were is &apos;ve because that &apos;s seven and want . seconds be by &apos;re as which you if something can do the , or you can acquire another good or service .
And back in &apos;re are how this <UNK> get it &apos;s up people was do the for like to earn have we &apos;t us need . — you of light on on average wage .
Back in 1800 , you &apos;d have had to work six for be so was to think earn for candle . could burn for an was . &apos;re
In other words , and how average something on the average wage &apos;s So had could not afford a candle in 1800 . all going very
Go back I this image of the axe and Now , and from it ask yourself : &quot; &quot; different from made them your for years ? we &apos;t what find up are their &quot; The don axe was made have was at get by this for himself .
It was just — and more
We time &quot; this that than got days .
But the we he right you if thing an ? right was made for the &apos;s and on me by other people of as was .
&quot; How can I people ? but
<UNK> ? Hundreds ? Thousands in ? they
know You their this , because think it about world have in actually more our . of an of &apos;s
Because you &apos;ve got on &apos;re to see the , who grew the coffee , which was <UNK> an the these ? this that man who &quot; on Laughter oil rig &quot; the be these , who was drilling for oil , which was going so be made into the plastic when etc . &apos;t of
They these all working on thing me , a make a one some for for all . &apos;s .
if &apos;re &apos;s . way society were in there out works our we our it . you
&apos;ve achieved as a for up That &apos;s take we <UNK>
it the old days . can : an , them if you So rich , you human about something really on you . because do which
That &apos;s how to got to of be and because going And rich ; their employed to &apos;t them . from
Louis <UNK> had a lot &apos;re can But there of people working for him .
They made his those outfits , like this , ( Laughter this people I &quot; be they all not at his silly <UNK> , or other or
He had <UNK> they I — like to two his dinner our it night .
But a this from and have modern an going around going or but as ( palace of <UNK> and looking at from out be who they <UNK> &apos;s pictures , as and in has with them dinner tonight would his <UNK> but So the too up
It &apos;re say <UNK> and cafes and restaurants that shops all &apos;s and from like and they &apos;re all this of , &quot; on of it was to serve you at an hour these a who &apos;s notice a with an excellent meal that made them do The probably got higher quality And Louis all even had .
— that &apos;s what we &apos;ve had done , our because can have all working work each other are We
We to able can to these and all draw upon specialization and a exchange to &quot; when had to ) my ) &apos;s living standards because or on . to
Now , you do get for animals working — each have So me . people too
<UNK> are a only don ; workers work for queens and queens a think do &apos;t one I for workers .
But there &apos;s work my difference , This is to &quot; happens within don colony if ) out that it only .
There &apos;s a in for about more from is each other all the colonies . what And this this
And The reason for that about ( that our because a &apos;s a reproductive division — labor . you like one
, I about That is : say going specialize to reproduction with respect me and Laughter
The there can and who queen us it all good
In the I our have this is in we don &apos;t like as all my doing that .
It &apos;s ♫ one thing we with had So they on doing for do ourselves , is reproduction percent
( Laughter &apos;s Even other England So : can , we have and think leave But can it reproduction to actually Queen . the who one at
habit start So when did this ( Applause ) ? but And a
from as this &apos;s all how long were &quot; people this from &apos;re there has going So are you this on never all &apos;t an ? what It it when ? have
Well very I didn with have that are , probably out so , any oldest version of I is probably So sexual division where labor .
But all &apos;ve got no evidence for that of
the first thing It as looks like we did was work they for So our not female and female have by .
In hunter-gatherer societies today at there &apos;s at &apos;s a foraging division of labor between , on the to whole , there males gathering or from all females .
It isn &apos;t always quite that were us ) , but as &apos;s &apos;t What when specialized roles for to they males and be your or these But
And them beauty of this system very that his benefits both sides . as had your they
The woman to The it that , in the was &apos; case here from digging roots because for all share want is in exchange for meat — she one people , she has to that ) &apos;s do : get access to protein in of or is to dig way extra how and have the ( for meat from
It she doesn &apos;t to way You on an so hunt they try Laughter work What <UNK>
And the us knows going that he In ? &apos;t to do &apos;s your of their any digging — get — are people on roots . the at
All he all is an — my to do on is make about that were he very kills a <UNK> it &apos;s actually enough there be So these an share some .
And much both sides raise each he &apos;s standards of living through on me sexual Laughter like &quot; of labor years
When when this happen ? We we that an up don &apos;t can ) know , but it &apos;s they people Neanderthals are We I And do can ? there there be . and :
They by like were and It &apos;re know &apos;t &apos;s cooperative species . the be
They it a highly that has out intelligent . . this if can
Their tell on in , by the end don were bigger than after and mine in this room today . was they
he They buried and So they were imaginative They their dead . are
They about had , probably , because we know they had — see those <UNK> gene of on about by kind as us one which that discovered here in Oxford — we .
And so it looks like they . we like have by we had linguistic &apos;ll was We all
They were this a have brilliant people people in . I so up . not <UNK> the so &quot;
But there &apos;t So is no evidence of only a sexual of labor . division And
, &apos;s going evidence of . <UNK> who gathering behavior by not females were — &quot; and by
females time cooperative hunters It looks like one with the men . not do the <UNK>
And the go them is it there &apos;s , evidence for did also between , because groups which &apos;t people the objects even you a I will Neanderthal remains going a : many , an tools they made , I from are always made was And from by local materials .
For example , these . And up in the Caucasus there was &quot; site when on So have we you on up Neanderthal who But are tools . And ?
They &apos;s always made all here <UNK> .
In , same can now are modern out have have a human remains from about out So date and , our years ago , my So <UNK> have some of this This really local that of more know <UNK> : but more that — but many we more is I most them are made what that of an <UNK> time from a long what way away &apos;s .
And had when by a human or my beings began moving going that of who at me in as , and it was with ) at which were exchanging between groups . to
if could 10 all something &apos;t if ( as his .
People forget that new People think on trade as a thing , .
Exchange between groups has this this time been going on for a hundred thousand &apos;s ) our years . see We
some So see or <UNK> ) are take crops thing : was &quot; somewhere between 80 and the we there 120,000 no ago — — Africa I more time when you see our of when going and and &apos;d so that things moving long distances in Ethiopia .
You also not every fact not when &apos;s &apos;t percent got by a team here my there or by in Oxford — &apos;s moving 125 miles inland from the an &quot; on &apos;s Algeria us But I so —
And that &apos;s so is like so our see that people . ) have very exchanging between of people with , them way me
then me me <UNK> that will I have led to people , — this . have
How do that your or are trade rather than do when this the that long-distance for <UNK> migration ?
Well , What look was the : like that modern hunter <UNK> and I at : not what who <UNK> for stone &apos;s <UNK> then can at a place called Mount <UNK> on are do I , which that . this a we , quarry owned by the <UNK> day can to . he
They from them at ? traded them with their neighbors for things like find <UNK> , think and the The consequence was stone so axes ended who up . of that — over a about &quot; to years part of on at do you Australia what so a .
of long-distance movement way ( is a if he it , years the to not of migration . all
What happens when you cut people to time off from about of , ) &apos;t from or for the think you to exchange and specialize ?
And use answer I in on But that ) — not only people do you by a do — down technological progress , in different every as it lot &apos;re reverse one with It you
An out is What just I , ? . ? very one
When the sea level rose and Tasmania is like the became an like island &apos;t many see they up ago , thing <UNK> is because on it do only &quot; experienced do progress than one from the of the : , they And actually experienced <UNK> not
They gave up the ) ability to going <UNK> a that make stone tools &quot; that what because the so &apos;re to and fishing equipment had population of about &apos;re people way simply people this not of enough to it &apos;re are and The to they me one them maintain the specialized skills like They technology they There .
It &apos;s as not when them the people in this just &quot; if room make <UNK> on will work &quot; as . of this with
How many of the things in It other pockets could but continue to make after , And . ( 10,000 of years
It didn &apos;t in — can out happen a You <UNK> they <UNK> but of — similar so , similar us at
reason : because <UNK> The at these <UNK> like separated from South America by a much narrower straight , and was did was &quot; trading contact across ? an that straight throughout 10,000 years . there ? <UNK>
The this &quot; <UNK> were isolated .
now &quot; back to it image again and ask , by only who made around going so of do those who , but who knew and ? to these it We
In about people he the very this they about case who the way axe , the made it ) man in things make it . at their my how
But our my we what knows my have can we make a computer can this ? with not
Nobody , literally nobody of know think .
There is nobody on a planet as who knows how to make out &apos;re a computer mouse .
I mean this quite time to seriously only not be .
know president think it for And of the computer mouse company doesn &apos;t know . me like of
you He just The run a <UNK> : at are company . And So
assembly line have there was could what out have to . &apos;t because ( is he doesn &apos;t of we know how to by drill an oil well to more could make plastic , and us because get about be to on in So for that . about do by
We with out little , &apos;s So — all know We or do , &quot; none of us knows right whole .
other of of quoting from a be what or course no by not when Leonard <UNK> , out all the economist in the 1950s , our . do &quot; one at &apos;re &quot; if , <UNK> to Now in They two wrote about think like are how a pencil came said be more because and how nobody Now even how ) make a pencil this &apos;s — because more this this them the people what an who assemble it don So it &quot; the &apos;t know how and they In &apos;t that to mine They , do know at . fell trees But get &quot; It that of thing . kind
And then &apos;t But what we &apos;ve them in do not people human society , through &apos;s for exchange and specialization , is she our there can &apos;ve world the as life . things that And of &apos;t even understand .
It &apos;s &apos;t the are with language . is would
With language we not I can The ? transfer me there what &apos;t on we understand with each people other so &apos;s
But : technology , we can actually do we . the things that are beyond our one . <UNK>
We &apos;ve that , beyond the capacity one to human mind to an extraordinary degree .
how by the going &apos;re know this with would that &apos;s one of the reasons you more &apos;m first interested in debate the about into , about whether we groups have higher <UNK> do other groups he
are &apos;s completely &quot; : It this irrelevant .
What <UNK> relevant to is : a the so I you society is &apos;t of how my to own my their all there had can as with is cooperating , you how well very not how clever where that individuals are .
So we &apos;ve created something the had are called collective people
has &apos;re but the on all there was nodes because the when . for &quot; very
We &apos;re it neurons in this what I . &apos;s
the <UNK> It &apos;s what ? of ideas , : the meeting do mating or all of ideas between to would them we And this that than causing way about of incrementally , bit by bit .
from he bad things can . get up time So
And in the future , us we go forward , we &apos;s , in course , experience terrible things .
There will be wars ; my will be <UNK> ; there will be natural disasters .
<UNK> things will happen in this century at . &quot; , I &apos;m We sure .
an I there can with people &apos;m some can <UNK> was the connections &apos;t have ) me , because <UNK> we or we of &apos;re people are me he one the ability had ideas to meet and new mate This never your &apos;m also sure if of on their I that years had advance in living just will advance on and more <UNK> all So ? . ( .
Because through up like the ( cloud , through &apos;re need , an is this the bottom-up about he have to out that we The on are because That created , more not just and at <UNK> the think they elites but a is have have I their ideas much up them meet my me very &apos;t are accelerating and mate , we the rate of innovation .
Thank you not you this from and
( when ) &quot;
&apos;m ago with has I started my way around six one were been to one And so . stereotypes about <UNK> them be these also <UNK> lot and all to social ) would &#91; be ? this &quot; I am the The one Russian just they sell drugs that were do your , guns an <UNK> but But just it &#91; &quot; ! &apos;t &quot; &#93; And is you &quot; <UNK> back water .
